one day , and the l.a. times columnists steve lopez in los angeles listening to a beautiful piece of music on the streets .
music is a man , an african - american men , rugged , using only have two and a violin string of .
now i 'm going to talk about this story because many of you already know the op - ed steve became a book , and then you get the basics of the movie , and robert Downey Jr steve anthony Ayer lopez jamie Foxx played nathaniel who he is the juilliard training double bassists of music , but his career , because with paranoia , schizophrenia , and unfortunately breaks
nathaniel from juilliard school music , and he was completely broken his 流落 skid row in los angeles , 30 years later , on the streets .
steve and i encourage you to look at all , or if you look at the film is not to be able to understand the ties between these two men to build a better , and if you look at the music is that , if you build this ties nathaniel homeless and change their lives , and that 's the most powerful tool .
mr. Ayers meet in 2008 , and i was two years ago at disney concert hall .
he listened to beethoven symphony , the first four 后天 to introduce
and he was talking to a very , very gregarious . the yo - yo and hillary clinton dodgers could n't go into the league of the world , and it 's because the last minute four in the beginning of the orchestra unpredictable beethoven violin role to play .
we talk a little bit of music . steve told me from nathaniel , a couple of days later , i got interested in me a violin 说学
i should mention was nathaniel refused to treatment , because when he of electroshock therapy with a deal with those handcuffed scars on his life .
of schizophrenia , and it turns out that he 's got a lot easier to attack the worst attack that he was going to disappear . nomadic exposed to a couple of days on skid row on the streets of release of fear , and the heart .
nathaniel back in such a state that when we started 第一课 disney hall , and his eyes , he was lost in the same direction .
and he talked about the invisible , some fog in his 睡觉时 poison him how
scared me worried about my own personal security , but it 's not afraid that i 'm going to lose and he went into his in a state of affairs , and he built a violin , and i 'm going to ruin the relationship between you and i started talking scale 和琶音 and other sorts of wonderful 说教式 violin 教学法 .
so , i began to 拉琴
first , i play beethoven violin concerto .
when i play , and i knew nathaniel changes in the eyes of a there .
what did he grabs the invisible drugs like through the chemistry , and i play the catalyst
he also understand that same anger and curious about quiet .
is amazing , and he picks up a violin , and he starts playing with some of these pieces , and he asked me to a violin concerto 门德尔松 , by tchaikovsky and 西贝柳斯
so we started talking about : bach music by beethoven , 布拉姆斯 布鲁克纳 , all the way from b to people with bartok 's name to 艾沙 佩卡 porta , 洛宁
and i understood that is not an encyclopedia of music , and he could connect these with his own music .
and he talked about the things that really passionate about understanding of music , if i told my colleagues in los angeles symphony communication between the .
by playing music , i 'm talking about this from a paranoia , and i still 晃悠 bum on the streets in los angeles , became a fascinating 博学 great musician 朱丽亚 conservatory educated .
we change that music is the antidote .
music is to help him for nathaniel on the mind .
because it can help delusional , and he and his mind through his imagination , creativity and becomes a reality .
and this is helping him possibilites from .
and i knew that the arts 真髓
that we make music and the reason we 're using a inside each of us have the heart of the most fundamental through the lens of our relationship with the art of our creativity , to shape our emotions .
and the reality is that we moved to all of us , and together we
and the music for nathaniel bring him back in a group of friends
music to save it bring him back to a family where people understand that he was having respect his
and i 'll never make music for the disney hall , or on the streets of skid row , because he was and why i 'm going to make a musicians .
thank you .
look at : thank you very much . thank you .
robert gupta .
robert gupta : now i 'm going to give you play 厚颜 窃来 from 大提琴手 melodies .
so , i beg
in my life with a lot of fish .
there are only two is one of my favorites .
first , it 's coming out of passion .
the fish , it 's a beautiful delicious , texture 细腻 fleshy , rich , and it 's the most popular menu of fish .
ah ! what a beautiful fish .
better , it 's the norms , and the goal is to keep the sustainability .
and the people who are going to be mode .
i 've been 沉醉于 this beautiful relationships , and about a few months .
and one day , it 's a company called me and invited me to the sustainable fisheries , and that activity .
i said , of course “ ” .
this company is trying to solve a problem for chefs , we 're are almost unthinkable . “ how are we going to leave fish on the menu ” ?
in the last 50 years , we like the logging fish from across the ocean .
it is not exaggerating damaging .
90 percent of the big fish species that we love , three tunas , the big fish , salmon 剑鱼 , they 're going to have gone extinct .
there 's hardly worth .
so , whether it 's good or bad 水产 养殖业 养鱼业 , will be part of our future .
for a lot of this industry , in fact , most of them are about 养鱼业 pollution , and it 's very inefficient , for example , which is the largest 弊病 tunas .
and the tuna feed 转换率 15 is more than one .
this mean for every 100 pounds of tuna 15 pounds to do with other wild fish feed .
it 's not really a sustainable 发展性 .
and it 's not good .
and finally , the company to do the right thing .
and i want to support them .
in that activity , and so i contacted before the department of p.r. company .
so we 're going to call him “ don 阁下 ” . "
i said , " “ don 阁下 , and i said , you know , it 's kind of fishing very well known in the ocean , and you ca n't contaminated . ”
his response : “ you say , we work on the far right . what we 're producing pollutants have been diluted out fishing , and where does n't focus on a ” .
and then he , is , we “ 独树一帜 .
feed 转换率 ? two - and - a - half - ” , and he said .
“ ” in the
two - and - a - half - , good .
“ two - and - a - half - ? what you 're feeding ” ?
he said , " “ sustainable ” proteins .
i said , " good “ ” , and hung up the phone .
it turns out , i was lying in bed , and said , " protein -- that 's what the hell ?
and so the next day , and in that activity , before i phoned don 阁下 . "
and i said , ' don 阁下 , did you some examples of proteins sustainable ? "
he said that he did n't know . he would go to the people around us .
and then , in some of the company and i 人通 phone calls , but nobody could give me a clear and the answer , until finally 我通 on the other one is the experts in biology .
and for me , and he “ don 阁下 ” . "
i said , " “ don 阁下 ” “ can 举例说明 sustainability protein ” ?
well , he talked about , and he talked about some algae and 鱼食 鸡丸 . "
and i said , " “ 鸡丸 ? ”
and he said , “ feathers 鸡皮 , bone dry dung , 添入 feed it later . ”
i said , " in the cattle are “ chicken ? ”
think about it , you know , two percent .
and so he said , " “ , about 30 percent of the ”
i said , " “ don 用鸡 阁下 , fish , 这算 sustainable 发展性 ” ?
side of the telephone silence for a long time , and he said to me , “ around the world , which is a lot of the chicken , ” .
so , i do n't love this fish .
no , not 伪善 , because i was feeling a job .
well , i was like that .
" no , i love this fish , because it 's not , i swear to god , that the conversation , and then 鱼尝 more like a chicken .
this is the second one another , which is a different kind of love .
romantic love is kind of fish , you know more about that , the more you love it .
the first time i eat the fish that in a restaurant , and at the southern spain .
a journalist , and i said , there 's a long time ago .
and she was an explicit .
the one on the table , it 's very bright , an aura , and the white .
chef cooks its time too .
it was cooking twice .
but it 's amazing , and it 's pretty good .
who can make this fish food , and still at the time cooked 过长 situations ?
i ca n't do it , but this guy .
let 's call him 米格尔 , it turns out that his name is 米格尔 .
fish , but he did n't have the cooking , and he was not a chef . at least in the way you understand what he did n't .
he was a biologist 薇 拉帕尔马 tower .
he was a 养鱼场 西南角 in spain .
he was in high - 克维尔 longtime river 尖部 .
it was n't until the last century , in the '80s and fishery argentinean population .
here they are the cows , which is basically the wetlands .
and they put water night .
and then build a complex canal , they put water and puts rivers .
i mean , they did n't succeed , but in terms of economic .
and the environment , a huge amount of disasters .
roughly 90 percent of the birds are gone , and in this area that 's a lot of birds .
in 1982 , a company with environmental awareness of the spanish for the land .
they 've done ? "
they turned the direction .
and they basically moving 卡关 .
instead of 排水 aqueducts , and they use this to bring water .
they were filled up the gowanus water .
and created a bass -- 27000 acres of fisheries , barracuda shrimp , 米格尔 鳗鱼 -- in this project , the company , and completely saved 生态灾难 .
this fishery fantastic creatures .
i mean , you 've never seen anything like that .
i looked at the horizon , it 's open water into your vision is being 注满 , the rich and the swamp wetlands .
and before long , 米格尔 and i 'd been there .
and he 's an amazing people , and it 's a quarter , crocodiles 邓迪 .
we went into the wetlands , and i 'm 气喘吁吁 淤泥 汗流浃背 , in my knee , and 米格尔 静静 a handout .
and here , and he pointed to a rare black 肩 鸢 . "
here , and he said to meet the needs of minerals oxygen .
there was this pattern , and he saw a bunch of people to 联想起 tanzanian giraffe .
it turns out , 米格尔 spent a long time working in africa 库米 national park .
and i asked him how to become an expert on the fish .
and he said , " “ ? i do n't understand them .
i 'm just a relationship between experts ”
and then he started a lot of talk about are scarce and birds and the algae 水生植物 . "
please do n't get me wrong , and that 's really interesting things , like biomes .
it 's pretty good , but i love it .
was always 惦记着 that i 've 前一晚 taste of being hyper - cooked food .
so i took him . i said , " “ 米格尔 fish , and what makes you good ? "
and he pointed to the algae .
“ my brother , you know , the algae , phytoplankton , relationships are amazing .
but what you eat the fish ?
feed 转换率 ? ” ?
and he told me , this is a very productive system on these fish , the things that are eating them in the wild .
woody vegetation , phytoplankton , plankton feed the fish .
this system is very healthy , it was completely self - updates .
do n't have any feed .
have heard of an animal feed feed on a farm , right ?
later , i was driving 米格尔 兜风 around , and i asked him , places like this looks like a natural “ ” unlike anything else , a farm , and i 've ever seen “ ” ? how you measure success .
and at that time , it seems to have a film director , to bring about change .
and we see images of the most beautiful , tens of thousands of pink curve , i can tell you a pink 火烈鸟 carpet .
and he said , " “ success . that 's ”
look at their abdomen “ pink .
they 're having a feast . ”
feast ? i lost .
i said , " “ 米格尔 communion , they were n't exactly what your fish ” ?
“ is , " he said .
“ birds and eat fish 20 percent of our eggs .
last year , and it 's fisheries 600000 只鸟 , more than half a different species .
now , this has become the largest private europe and the most important bird 自然保护区 .
i said , " “ 米格尔 , the number of birds that 's not a fishery , do n't want to ” ?
no , he 摇摇头 .
he said , " “ in general , and we are not consciously .
it 's an eco - network .
these are 火烈鸟 eat shrimp .
shrimp 浮游动物 . "
so , in their belly 鲜艳 pink , and the system as well . ”
. okay , let 's go back to look at a farm fed animals , and it does n't give it to measure their success is based on its predators .
a bird fishery , and it 's also a house .
and by the way , the 火烈鸟 , where they 're not supposed to do .
they breed in town , and in the soil , there 's more than 150 miles away for 做巢 .
every morning , and they fly into this fishery 150 miles .
and at night , and they were flying over 150 miles went home .
but they do it because they can and A92 white on the highway .
no joke .
imagine i 've been in your mind endorsing penguins diary here , i looked like 米格尔 . "
i said , " “ 米格尔 150 miles , and they fly fishery , and they fly back at 150 miles an hour away ?
they do it for the kids ” ?
and he looked at me like i just took the whitney houston song .
“ , he said , " no , they 're doing it because it 's worth of food ” even better .
i do n't want to talk about my favorite fish and the right , which is really quite tasty , i usually do n't like the skin , and i do n't like baking . i do n't usually like 脆 .
it 's , like 柏油 peppery .
and i do n't do it with a fish .
the restaurant , but when i was in southern spain taste , it was n't tasted like skin .
it tasted 微甜 尝 clean , and as you took a bite of the ocean .
i mentioned 米格尔 to my mind , and he nodded .
he said , " “ skin acts like a sponge .
it is to prevent any material into the maginot line in the last .
it 's the role of absorb contaminant . ”
and he said , " “ , but we do n't contaminated water ” .
a 渔厂 . ok . it does n't feed the fish fishery to measure its success , it 's an enemy of success .
and i realized that , when he said , " an understatement , he said , " no 杂质 fishery , because in the fisheries 克维尔 longtime high through the water from the river .
now in the river in every one of the river , chemical pollutants have pesticides , accumulate .
and then when it 's off into the system , and then , more than , clean water .
health care system , it 's able to filter the water .
this fishery , it 's not just does n't feed the animals , so it 's not just to the success of the health of predators , but it 's a fishery , basically 水净化 plants , and it 's not only for the fish , but in order to you and me .
because the water out of here , it 's the atlantic .
this works is , i know something about it , but i think it 's very important , and you should , because this is not romantic love , and educational .
and you might say , it 's a food in the future , we 're talking about 鲈鱼 or beef .
we need to do now is a new concept of agriculture , which is a real food .
so , for a lot of people , but there 's an extreme .
we 're not realist , our job . we love .
we love to the market . we love a small farm 家庭式 . we 're talking about regional food we eat organic food .
and when you want to suggest that this is going to make the future of food , somewhere by somebody who stood up and said , " i said , " man , i fell in love with the pink 火烈鸟 , but how do you make this filling in the world ?
how do you attenuate for the world ? "
and i can be a little bit ?
i do n't like your problem .
no , it 's not just because we 've made than in the world that we need to do .
a billion people in the 饿着肚子 today .
- billion - 那比 -- more than ever been on the root of the distribution of imbalance , not by a 吨位 .
i do n't like the real question because he had 拟定 a food system , the logic exists in the last 50 years .
grain herbivores to the chemicals , and also crop varieties pesticides , the soil , the chicken , all sorts of agriculture , and you can just ask them “ , if we 're using a method of cheaper to more people ” , what 's wrong ?
motivation . it has become a sense of that . it 's a business plan that agriculture in the united states .
that we should be , it 's a in 清算 business , very quickly , the business of capital that made this possible .
it 's not a business , it 's not agriculture .
today are under threat , not because of our food supply , because it is , is diminishing 递减 resources .
from tractors , not by the latest 嫁接 technology , but also fertile soil , not by water , but the fresh water , no chainsaws , but on the forest , and on and on the net , but it 's not the fish in the ocean .
do you want to feed the world ?
so we began to wonder : how do we feed our ? "
or better yet , how are we going to create an environment where it can make a group to feed itself ?
so used to do that , do n't expect the future , the agricultural model now .
it 's obsolete , and it 's very sick .
because it 's dependent on capital , chemistry , and production machine , and it 's not really good food .
instead , let 's look at the patterns .
and there 's 20 billion 实战经验 .
look at 米格尔 , like 米格尔 farmers .
not only to their own farms , and it 's self , rather than using farm of farmers , instead of a special relationship between experts , but it 's not the producers ,
because they 're also flavors of experts .
and if i want to be honest , they are better than i cook .
you know , i did n't agree with something like this , because if the quality of the future of food , and they will be quite tasty .
thank you very much .
if i 'm going to leave you with one idea is that we consume information about what all this data - rich than the sum 相加 part of all this data , which is that we consume information than the sum 相加 part of the rich , and that 's what all this data that we consume information than the sum 相加 part of the rich , and instead of information , and i want you to think about how to use these patterns of information , and that would allow us to see , unseen .
so what we 're seeing here is a typical chart rates by age groups
and i 'm here is a tool , a little experiment .
call it , i can use Pivot Pivot filter special die , such as an accident .
immediately , and i saw a show in different patterns .
because , in the most people here in the middle ages , and here is the 体弱多病
that we can back according to die and we see disease and cancer is killing the symptoms , but it 's not for everybody .
filter , for example , if we 're going to age 40 below , we can see that it becomes a kind of people who need to be careful .
even further , and if you will discover that one for the men .
okay , so that you probably know , the role of the way of looking at the data , it 's like a living and working in this picture .
if we were able to do the data ? why do n't do it on the content .
so we 've shown here in the issue of the sports .
all of them all in this case , on the web .
you can go back in the end of my talk , you see the room .
Pivot , and you can use to look for the last 10 years .
you can go to a year .
and you can go into the issue of
for example , when i saw this ; i saw that appeared in 期中 athletes , in sports .
i 'm a fan of lance armstrong , which is why i continue to click on it , i 'm just going to show you all this is a lance armstrong and part of the problems .
so again , now , if i just wanted to sample the peak of the data , and i thought , well , if you look at how all of a bicycle ?
as a result , i can take a step back , and it 's a little bit .
now , i saw , greg 莱蒙 "
so you 're going to see what happens when you take this way , through the narrow reverse wide , and , you 're not , it 's not to .
you 're doing is actually a little bit different .
somewhere in the middle , and we think it 's really changed the way that access to information .
so , i was on the idea that is something a little bit crazy .
we do is to pluck up here every wikipedia page , and the size of a little 摘要
摘要 on one graph shows profession , it came from .
i 've just shown here is the most popular wikipedia page 500 years ago .
but even in these very limited views , we can do a lot of things .
wikipedia , and we know what 's the most popular .
and i keep to the government .
now , with the government after selected , i can see in the category of the wikipedia is the time of year corresponds to 风云人物
and this is one of the most important , because that 's not a wiki page 所载述 content .
only you back a few , that might look at the big 透彻 .
if you look at these particular time magazine , and then i go in the economy of the 风云人物 inside them .
so , if you look at these guys , i can see from the science of most of us from the government . there 's less of a business . one of my head a from music .
and interestingly , bono 's ted prize winner .
and so we can continue to get redirected , if you look at the ted prize winner .
so you see , for the first time , that 's what we 're working on the internet as if it 's a web pages , and it 's not just the higher 抽象层次 on the net .
so i want to tell you another thing that might surprise you .
and i 'll just show in the new york times website .
Pivot apps , which is -- i do n't want to call it the browser , and it 's not just a browser , and you can browse -- and we use it for everybody , like the web . and we give everyone can rescale technologies like the web and you can rescale it .
so i can step back , back to a particular place .
why this is important , because the benefits of how to browse through , and i can see exactly the same way through all of history .
and so i could go on the top of the time .
here , in fact , i showed you all the time .
i can 重放 in a way to look a little bit earlier today .
what if i want to take a step back and look at everything , maybe i can cut the history of the search history , and i 've done some related searches for live , where the microsoft Labs Pivot .
from this , i can only 重启 web them .
information , because this is the same time combination of the different times , and that 's more than the information together , the whole time . and that 's more than the overall by information together .
now , in the world , and we 're talking about the data that curse .
we 're talking about 魔咒 big bang .
we 're talking about in the ocean .
and if we could take this idea of the internet of information , as opposed to 单线 habit of links , and let 's start diverse information links diversity , and see that the way , do n't see the pattern ? and then see the way , this ca n't see the pattern ?
if we can do that , rather than trapped in the data , we 're going to get the information .
and it 's not just process information , and we can tease out .
if we get knowledge and wisdom and then you can see .
thank you very much .
i grew up in the science fiction company .
every day , i 've got to the high school bus back of an hour .
long in the outside , i 've always been steeped in the book , and the idea of science fiction to the rest of the world , the narrative of the way , to me was a strong sense of wonder .
in addition to that , i wonder , and the other aspect : i do n't need to class , i would go to the forest , and collect specimens “ ” , frogs , snakes , bug , " yeah , it 's 池水 通通 back home , and put it underneath the microscope .
and i was , a gourmet 狂人 science .
but it was to try to understand the world , maybe the boundaries .
and my favorite of science fiction is that corresponds to the world around me , because it was in the late '60s , people started , the moon , into the deep sea .
jacques . august , film , he would be amazing . the visual effects of our lives , before we had the wonderful animals ca n't imagine , with a landscape of the world .
all this kind of resonance between science fiction .
in the meantime , i 'm an artist .
i 'm 绘能 .
because i 've found that there was no video games are seeping special effects , and in a lot of the media industries image in my mind , i had to create these images .
that young people , and i was at school , and often in our brains , writers described 东西向 films .
and i could n't respond to describe the aliens , robotic spacecraft alien world , and so forth .
i hide behind the textbook doodling 行径 teacher to 逮个 are being .
and so i have for the rest of 宣泄 creative ways for me .
interestingly , jacques . august film that i was surprised to find out on the planet , there is an alien world .
i ca n't be true in our lifetime spacecraft to marginals . it sounds so alien world .
that exists on the planet , but i can go to a world -- and an abundance of all , i was all about .
so in the year i was 15 - year - old , i decided to become a diver .
but the only problem is , i was living in a small village in canada , to the nearest sea 600 miles an hour .
but i do n't have grown disenchanted .
and i and my dad , and it was n't until i found a dive in new york city for selling water 训练班 , it 's on the other side of the 美加 borders .
in the water , that 's selling 刺骨 深冬 , within the christian camp 泳池 diving , i got a certificate .
and i too , but the next two years , the ocean , until we 've moved to california .
40 years after that , i spent underwater is about 3,000 hours of five hours in the submersible .
i found out into the sea -- even the shallow water -- there is an amazing of life , and went far beyond our imagination .
compared with our narrow range of what 's the nature of the imagination .
until today , i watched the diving 仍令 everything was surprising to me .
i love to the ocean , did n't change .
, but when i was 择业 , an adult , and i chose filmmaker .
at this point , it 's going to tell me desire for the creation and images of the best way .
and when i was a kid , i always cartooning .
and the movies and images and stories together , of course , happen automatically .
and of course , i 'm talking about is all about science fiction story " terminator , " sex and the abyss . "
in the magazine , i was a deep dives love and the movies together .
and my passion , 合二为一 .
and the abyss " and it also brings up another story , in order to represent the film , to create some liquid 水生物 of technology , we started using a computer animation .
first in the world of computers and character , soft surfaces .
despite the fact that the 电影票房 不济 , and it back to it , and i saw an amazing -- a global audiences all the magic with the video .
-- that the laws of arthur c. clarke state - of - the - art and science is to distinguish between the magic .
and the audience are seeing what was the magic .
this was incredibly exciting .
“ god , i was thinking , this technology in the movie . the adoption ” of art .
so my next film called " terminator , " we 're going to be two new technology pushed the stairs .
with industrial 光魔 “ ” effects film with the guy in the liquid metal , and we created a video . and the success of the movie or will depend on this technology could work .
and it worked . again , again , we created a magic . we get the same , but from the work that movie is a little bit better .
add twice , we realized that it 's going to be a whole new world of art , allowing the movie . the imagination of the new world .
so , with my friend Stan Winston formed a company . Stan Winston was the name of the known companies and artists 造型师 . it 's called the digital Digital Domain .
and the idea is actually the optical 蛙跳 companies and character , directly into digital .
in fact , we did that , we 're really 先机 the period of time .
but in the mid - 1990s , we found was even companies in biological design , who is 建树 , but we have on this scooped .
so i created this " avatar , aimed to limit , using a computer graphics and 视觉效果 animators to create a real human emotion . the main character and i 'm going to have a computer , and the whole scene and i 'm going to have a computer .
. but i did 一鼻子灰 people told me that we 're in our company , the technology was conditions are unable to do the effects .
so i 'm going to put that idea , and made a film about 大船 went down to the movie .
companies like i was a film , the film is going to be on the boat “ romeo and juliet ” , is going to be a romantic epic and passion .
but 私底下 , my goal is to visit the titanic debris .
this is the reason that i 'm making films .
so , i 'm talking about that movie . but it was the uninformed .
i 'm trying to convince them . i said , " “ field , we 're going to dive in 船骸 取景 .
some of the opening .
this is very important , a theater . ”
so i 'm trying to convince them to invest in a perilous journey .
it sounds crazy , but ultimately , is that if you use your imagination about how to create a reality .
in fact , we did in six months later -- i created a reality in the north atlantic 2.5 miles in russia , in a submersible , through an underwater 视口 past the titanic .
not movies , high - resolution , but it 's a moment .
so , what i was totally amazed .
a touch is terrific , we need to work , the camera lights , and so forth .
but what really struck me is that these deep dives . as space exploration .
both the deployment of high - tech product , both be serious .
you step into cabin , into this dangerous environment , in the dark , if you ca n't rely on their own power to the rescue , you do n't have any possible .
and i was thinking about : “ god , i was like in a 科幻电影 inside .
so cool ” .
and so deep expedition became my new indulgence .
and of course , it boils down to one of the curious about everything , scientific . it 's a sense of transcendence , imagine 探求 is a curious capacity , which is an infinite number .
it ca n't give me a hollywood .
that i could imagine a creature , and it uses graphics created , but i ca n't imagine that all of what i see diving windows .
in the process of exploration and then we look , i have to live in the hydrothermal vents , sometimes you can see , sometimes the things i 've never seen before anyone here have n't seen before , or even before we had the and not be described of science .
and so i 'm all shook up , to continue .
so i made a surprise to me .
in a successful , and i said , " the titanic “ well , i 'm making films in hollywood , that would work in a conclusion . in the next time , i 'm going to be a full - time explorer . ”
so we started these expeditions .
we 're heading 俾斯麦 wreck , using robotic device to detect the wreckage .
we then went back to the wreckage of the titanic .
and i created a robot that can wrap optical fibers .
aim is to look deeper and deeper into debris , to explore the internal -- an adventure .
no one has seen this before . they do n't have the inside of technology , so we need to create the technology .
you know , i was on the deck of the titanic , sitting in a submersible , looked like this deck of wood , and i thought was performed band here .
i played with a small 船内 over the hallway robotic exploration .
while i was trying to control it , and this is my mind 器内 exploration .
and i 'm really in the wreckage of the titanic .
that 's what i 've experienced in the sense of this incredible had met , because before the robots to detect light up around , and i know that all of the hidden behind every corner of the film , and the reason is the process of making , and i spent a lot of months around in this scene .
and in fact , this is a ship in the studio and made a model of a real .
so that was an extraordinary .
it makes me feel a telepresence robots -- we have these on the experience of avatar , we 're going to be one of our ideology , with an alternate existence .
and this is really quite profound experience .
maybe it allows us to guess how many decades later in the world of overall . and as a scientific 小说迷 when i can imagine the future of human society , a cyborg for exploration , and the other .
so through this exploration , i really started to look at the bottom of the wonderful , wonderful animals that live in the deep sea 裂口 . they are , in the is alien creatures on this planet .
they live in a chemosynthetic environment .
we do n't need the light .
so when you look at those 50 degrees in the 地柱 , the animal .
do you think they 're completely impossible to survive .
in the meantime , i 'm also interested in the space of technology . this is a natural started by a young and the effect of science fiction .
space , and i founded the community , it 's very , very closely related to collaborate with nasa , to become a part of the board , they 're really curate space mission , russia went to visit before the astronauts biology , with all sorts of things that we brought in a 3d camera gear on the international space station .
this is memorable experience .
but by the end , i follow scientists to space , we went into the deep ocean .
allow them to personal experiences . a space , the object and scientists have people who are interested in the extreme environment we 裂口 into the deep ocean , and to show that they can actually take samples 探测仪器 , and so forth .
so in the documentary , and we study science 太空科学 .
小说迷 science as a kid , i 'm going to experience and industry in the real experience to .
in this voyage , and i learned a lot of stuff .
and i learned a lot about science , but i also learned a lot of leadership in order to do something about .
director you have a talent , and it 's our leaders is 掌舵者 , and so forth .
in this exploration , i do n't know anything about leadership is to get before .
because ultimately , i want to ask yourself : “ what i was doing this ?
now , why am i doing ” ? what do i get these things ?
these damn it does n't make a film .
we wo n't be easy 没名 all 回本 没份 .
a lot of people think i was in the titanic . " and " " avatar 退居幕后 , sitting on a beach 修指甲 .
but in fact , i made this film , these films , is very few people .
没名 , no , no money , what on earth are you doing ?
i 'm doing it for this experience for the value of the challenge -- and the sea , which is the most of the environment , and i was doing this for the discovery of a kind of a small group of people , in order to make sense of wonder when they hit by a team together , wonderful cohesive .
because every time we work with 10 to 12 people sometimes a couple of years to stay on the sea on a two - three months .
and coherency that , you realize that the most important thing is a collaboration with them to respect each other , you have to explain to people ca n't .
when you go back to the coast , and you say , we need to do this fiber opticals “ 电律 decrease , and this , man . the level of technology , ” -- these are the productivity of the sea , you ca n't explain it to others . it 's like the 同甘共苦 , as the warrior , they do n't know what they are unable to one of the experience .
to create a cohesion , to create a respect for cohesive .
so when i went back to make my next film " avatar , and i tried to apply the same respect -- that you 're leading a team , and you go back to respect .
and this is the one that 's actually changed the team .
again , with a small team who came together to make an unknown territory " avatar , there had to create a new technology .
exciting .
a challenge .
in a four - and - a - half - year period , we became a family .
this experience changed the way that i made a film .
they comment said , " you bring back into the sea creatures that people on the horizon 潘朵拉 on this planet .
and for me to focus on the fundamental principles of things , the process itself , and things have changed .
so what did we get from this ?
what did i learn ?
and i think the first is curiosity .
this is what you have the most powerful thing .
imaginative power is a map of reality .
and your team of respect for you to than all the other half of the crown of the world .
sometimes the film director asked me , “ in terms of advice . give me some movies ”
and the answer is : do “ limitations yourself .
someone wants to be limited , for you , but you 're not limited to the dice . do n't lose themselves , to take risks . ”
the nasa has a quote : they liked “ failure is not an option . ”
but in the arts and adventure , it must be a failure option , because we all need to the challenge .
no need to be important for innovation is not the risk of conditions .
you 've got to be willing to take the risk .
and that 's what i want to leave you with all of the enlightenment , no matter what you do , is one of these choices , but it 's not fear . thank you very much .
i 'm going to talk about today is the energy and climate change , it would be a little bit surprising
i 'm going to talk about today is the energy and climate change , it would be a little bit surprising , because i was in the full - time job and agriculture 种苗 the vaccine is about the disease was invented spread , and we need to improve the lives of the poorest two billion people on earth is the stuff that we need to spread , in order to improve the lives of the poorest two billion people in the world of things .
but energy and climate change , in fact , these guys . in fact , it 's going to be more important than the people on the planet , but in fact , energy and climate change for these guys . in fact , it 's going to be more important than the people on earth
for the climate change , it means they ca n't grow crops that will be years ago , which means 洪涝 or drought does for the climate . they ca n't grow crops that will be years ago , which means 洪涝 of vulnerability and drought these changes in ways that they cannot withstand a change in ways that they ca n't fragile environment .
it will lead , famine , which causes riots social instability ,
so climate change , to bring them , and also 能源价格 严重后果 critical for them .
so climate change , to bring them , and also 能源价格 严重后果 critical for them .
and in fact , if we can reduce the price of something by reducing poverty , you 're going to be one 能源价格 , in fact , if you can reduce the price of something by reducing poverty , you 're going to be one 能源价格
能源价格 down with the history of mankind , advanced civilization is based on the basis of that energy .
能源价格 down with the history of mankind , advanced civilization is based on the basis of that energy .
before the industrial revolution , the coal in the early 20th century , we have a choice rapidly falling , this is the air conditioning , because we were able to get them back in the early 20th century , we have a choice rapidly falling , this is what we were able to enjoy the refrigerators air conditioning and the reason that we can have a lot of modernity , they 'll be able to do all sorts of things .
that power , and we can do it in a wealthy world live with this beautiful .
, but when we were to reduce the choice to make it affordable , twice as much as we have a new constraints of this limitation , with co 2 , we have a new constraints limit , which is associated with carbon dioxide .
co 2 is the co 2 emissions equation of global warming , and it 's very easy to co 2 is global warming , and the co 2 emissions equation is very straightforward .
is a huge co 2 emissions , which is the temperature rises to put a huge co 2 emissions caused a temperature of the temperature up to a series of very serious consequences for the weather , or a direct implications for our ecosystems , indirectly , the result of the ecosystem with radical change all of the ecosystem collapses for the weather , or a direct implications for our ecosystems , indirectly , the result of the ecosystem with radical change all of the ecosystem collapses for the weather , or a direct implications for ca n't deal with the ecosystem indirectly , ecosystems , the result is full of the ecosystem collapses .
co 2 emissions , and the temperature up on the relationship between how positive effects of co 2 emissions . why ? " and the temperature rise on the relationship between how positive effects of co 2 emissions . why ? " and the temperature rise on the relationship between how positive effects ? why this is some of them do n't know for sure , but not in the middle .
and the dark side of global warming , it 's not quite sure , but here 's how heavily there must be very negative severe , the specifics of global warming , it 's not quite sure , but certainly more extreme .
and i had to the top scientists : we 're going to be really co 2 emissions down to zero ? and i had to the top scientists : we 're going to be really co 2 emissions down to zero ?
it down to half - of - a - quarter or not ?
the answer is , unless we otherwise temperatures going up , down to zero , and that 's going to be a massive challenge , and the answer is , unless we otherwise temperatures going up , down to zero , and that 's going to be a huge challenge .
the answer is , unless we otherwise temperatures going up , down to zero , and that 's going to be a huge challenge .
and that 's from a 12 - foot by truck 限高 10 - foot bridge , and to 挤过去 . it 's not just to make a 12 - foot by 限高 truck , just to 挤过去 10 - foot bridge .
co 2 emissions are going to be completely it down to zero .
our current total amount of co 2 emissions , and every year than 260 tons of co 2 emissions of every year we , the more than 260 gigatons
in poor countries , about 20 tons per capita 人约 emissions worldwide , less than a ton per capita emission 人约 about 50,000 metric tons of the united states , about 20 tons per poor countries , less per ton per capita emission around about 50,000 metric tons .
in poor countries , about 20 tons per capita 人约 emissions worldwide , less than a ton per capita emission about 50,000 metric tons .
anyway , we 're going down to zero , until you change the numbers , but anyway , we 're going to change , and put it down to zero .
and it 's continued to increase , yet only 经济波动 inhibits its up a little bit .
this yet , only 经济波动 continued to increase in the control of the rise of momentum which we 're not going to turn up the momentum , all the way down to zero to make it down , and we 're not going to turn them very quickly the momentum , to make it up , and the way down to zero .
the carbon equation of four , 四者 multiply the carbon equation of equation 四者 multiplied together , there are four things on the left co 2 emissions , our goal is to make it down to zero co 2 x 2 = population of per capita average 耗用 services for every unit of x amount of co 2 x amount of energy per unit of energy use co 2 x 2 = 人口总数 per capita average 耗用 services for every unit of x amount of co 2 x amount of energy per unit of energy use co 2 x 2 = 人口总数 per capita average 耗用 services for every unit of x amount of co 2 x amount of energy per unit of energy and let 's see individual factors that equation , if you look at how will ultimately the numerator below zero , let 's see individual equation , if you look at how will ultimately zero
obviously , we need to be at least one very factors 近于零 algebra high school , and it 's very simple .
clearly , we need to be at least one very factors 近于零 algebra ♫ high school , and it 's very simple , let 's take a look at the first one is the population
the first one is the population , let 's take a look .
now 6.8 billion people in the world , it will continue to grow to about nine billion people in
now 6.8 billion people in the world , it will continue to grow to about nine billion people in
if we were working on a vaccine , reproductive health care , the job done . if we develop a new vaccine and reproductive health care , can work to do . that 's probably 10 to 15 percent reduction , so the rate of about 1.3 this might be able to 10 to 15 percent reduction , so the rate of about 1.3
the factors that we use .
all this stuff , the food we ate all wearing clothes , television , heating , it 's something really wonderful things , including things : the food we ate all wearing clothes , television , heating , these are great .
all this stuff , the food we ate all wearing clothes , television , heating , it 's something really wonderful things out of poverty , that every single person on the planet into these services , the factors that you are good out of poverty , every single person on the planet to these services , and the factors that you are good .
poverty it means to every single person on earth provides services , and the factors that you are good .
of a billion people in the developed world , the most affluent consumer , maybe we can control , by some services in the developed world of a billion people , maybe we can control of the most affluent consumer and reduce the service , but in general , this year , it will rise , and enjoying the per capita services , as it 's not , but in general , it will be year , and enjoying the per capita services , as more than that , but in general , it will be year , and eventually get services , as more than average
in this area , and we had some very basic services , you have on the light of the lights ? in this area , and we had some very basic services , you have on the light of the lights ?
without these kids , and so they 're going to go out and sit down the street no written homework , these kids , and so they 're going to go out and sit down the street writing courses .
here is a very efficient , which is for each of our energy consumption in this , we have some good news : factors that wo n't be 持续上升
on this , we have some good news : factors that wo n't be up .
and through all the cars with new technologies , new ways of light , a new way of building in new ways of light and all kinds of innovation , with new technologies , new car service by the way we can take a lot of energy consumption of the individual , and we can reduce the 90 percent reduction , what could be a lot of the energy consumption of driving , 90 percent of individual services , and you can reduce
service that we could be a lot of energy consumption , individual 大大降低 services , and can even 90 percent .
and some other services , like fertilizer , 航空运输 promotion , but rather limited space and some other services , like fertilizer , 航空运输 promotion , but rather limited space and some other services , like fertilizer 航空运输 , etc. , and you can make up a limited space , rather than
integrated perspective , this optimism , and that is , maybe we can get three to six . so , about the integrated perspective , this is , maybe we can get three to six .
, we have about three factors , down to the emissions from the 260 tons 130 gigatons ; it 's not enough , we have about three factors , down to the emissions from the 260 tons 130 gigatons ; it 's not enough , we have about three factors , down to the emissions from the 260 tons 130 gigatons ; it 's not enough
and finally , we see a fourth factor , which is the key thing is , if you look at the end , which is one of the most important things , which is the co 2 emissions per unit of energy .
the question is , we can do things that down to zero ?
certainly not 烧气 , coal .
certainly not 烧气 , coal .
all of the power of the way we produce carbon dioxide , except for all of the development and renewables nuclear power we have all the way we produce carbon dioxide , except for developing renewable with nuclear power .
and so , we need to develop a new global energy systems , we need to do , so we need to develop a new global energy systems , we need to do .
and so , we need to develop a new global energy systems , we need to do .
miracle , even though i 've “ ” word , but it does n't mean that it is impossible .
microprocessors miraculous , pc was miraculous , and this is the internet .
microprocessors miraculous , pc was miraculous , and this is the internet .
in other words , and you 've seen in a miracle happening .
normally , we 're not going to happen at the end of the deadline , we do n't normally in the last deadline for .
typically , you just do a little miracles , some people do n't just happened .
in this low - carbon emissions , which we need to fight , and before the ultimate deadline for the magic , but this low - carbon emissions , and we have to fight , and before the ultimate deadline for this .
how much better , i think that this is an expression of a natural ?
how much better , i think that this is an expression of a natural ? is it that i 'm going to show you some spark of imagination ?
me back to a year ago , i brought some mosquitoes here , and if you like it , and i came back to a year ago , i brought some mosquitoes here , and if you like it .
that really 与会者 to realize that some people in the world is the mosquito that 与会者 to live with that some people are really started to realize that , in the world live with that .
and so , if you talk about today is , i think that 's fireflies .
fireflies are going to fly , and i decided that i am here to the environment , so i decided to release fireflies environmental contribute to this year , i 'm going to be here .
and this is a natural fireflies , who was n't bite , maybe they 're 懒得 out of that .
and this is a natural fireflies , who was n't bite , maybe they 're 懒得 out of that .
there 's a natural fireflies , who was n't bite , maybe they 're 懒得 that jar of , like fireflies to solve problems have to have a lot of energy , but it 's actually a very limited , like fireflies . there are a lot of our energy problems have to , but it 's actually very limited .
solutions that we need is a very 规模性 , or a lot of celebration and the solution , and we need is a solution , or a lot of you , very reliable and 规模性 solutions that we need is a solution , or a lot of solutions , despite the fact that they want , and it 's very 规模性 and reliability , only five 多方 exploration , and i think we can as big as people in the direction 多方 exploration , i think it 's now can 有大 as five .
and i do n't have the tides , geothermal fusion biofuels , who are going to have .
i do n't have the tides , geothermal fusion biofuels , and that would be a difference if they can do better than i would , of course , but the key thing is , in five ways to all of us , but the thing is , we invest in five to all the way , because they do n't seem hard instead of investment , because they ca n't contains tough challenges they seem hard instead , because they 're all of the challenges
let 's start with fossil fuels , coal 烧气 , first of all , if you look at the fossil fuels , coal or 烧气
, we need to do , and it 's not just needed to do is to take all the burning of the co 2 , through the chimneys collecting things , and pressure , stored , they need to do is to take all the burning of the co 2 , through the chimneys collecting and pressure , and things , and that is not leak energy needed to do is to take all the burning of the co 2 , through the chimneys collecting and pressure , and things , and that is not leak energy
60 percent of the trial had been able to do is to 80 percent of all , but it 's going to be 100 percent of the trial had been able to do is going to be very difficult to 60 percent of the level of 80 percent of it , but it was very difficult thing to 100 percent , and where the store , a huge amount of co 2 , and the most difficult -- it 's a very controversial long - term .
who can make it ?
the waste , a billion times and other waste off , who can make these long - term security ? waste , a billion times and other waste off , who can make a long - term security ?
this is a very large amount of co 2 , and so difficult
this is a very large amount of co 2 , and so difficult
next , nuclear , the three big problem .
next , nuclear , the three big problem . it costs , especially in 管控 countries , and very high - security issues , that whole discipline , even though there is an operation , even 核燃料 wo n't be used as weapons .
and how to deal with nuclear waste .
it , even though it is , but there 's a lot of concerns .
the solution to make people feel 安心 .
three problems , but it might be able to solve the problem , so you need to work .
and finally , i 'm going to put together in three five energy
this is often called three renewable energy .
in fact , they do n't need to fossil fuels , but also have shortcomings
the first one is the energy density , collect these technologies are much less than plants , first of all these technologies to collect the energy density , much less .
energy is scale agriculture , which is a kilometer 几千倍 larger than the plant .
energy , and this is that .
the sun 's not all day , every day , the wind blowing and not have been
if it 's completely depend on those of you have spent 间歇期 in other ways to energy , you have to spend energy , and there are other ways 间歇期
as a result , we have a huge problem , and the cost of the challenges , for example , in terms of energy source , in some of you do n't need energy , not only to deal with our energy in the risks .
and then finally , the store .
in order to make this problem , and i looked at all the cells in order to make this problem , and i looked at all , the batteries , with a computer , a mobile phone , a flashlight , all sorts of things , put it on a battery 电量 everyday world consumes electricity storage , i realized that we 're now making all of the battery of only 10 minutes of all the energy .
so , in fact , we need a big breakthrough technology , the good times than a solution to a better than technology now 100 solutions .
, but it 's not impossible , and it wo n't be easy .
energy , so we can use that 20 , 30 percent of the energy needs .
100 percent , but if you want to rely on it , you need is a very efficient batteries .
so , how can we do on the right way , where ?
this is one of the manhattan project ? how are we going to get to the side ?
we need to work a lot of companies , and companies 几百家
for every one of the five ways , we all need at least 100 team of people .
there 's a lot of people , you would think they 're really crazy , and that 's right .
in the ted community , i think a lot of people who have started working on .
bill have 好几家 company , one of these solar 发热 eSolar , which is a great technology called eSolar bill have 好几家 company , and one of the solar fever has a great technology .
vinod , the 科斯 invested in their work great 几十家 company , which is a very interesting possibility , and i was planning to support their project .
纳珊米赫 wald , and i 've been in a company that maybe a little bit surprising , but it 's the company of nuclear power .
in terms of nuclear , even though there recently and innovation , like the mold , little fluid .
innovation , but it turns out that it 's got to stop for a while , so now , there were some good idea of what it 's not too strange thing .
Terrapower burning the idea is not a normal uranium U235 Terrapower : the idea was to burn uranium U235 they burn the rest of the 99 percent of the ordinary , which is U238
and this is a kind of crazy idea , but in fact , people have talked about for a long time
and this is a kind of crazy idea , but in fact , people have never talked about for a long time , but it 's pretty good to mimic does this work had a supercomputer to upgrade our modern world , and we can now do a simulation , and you can see , as with the material , which is a viable
and , because we are burning discarded 99 percent of the waste before you can reduce the cost
you make waste is actually a nuclear reactor will have to worry about how to deal with all the fuel , it 's a waste of good news .
never have to worry about how to deal with all the reactor waste , and this is a good news .
this technology , like a candle , uranium 烧尽 waste
normally it like this one , this is called wave reactor
the problem solved .
this is a waste in kentucky .
is that the waste , 99 percent of the U235 uranium called out of fuel runs out .
all across the united states can 数百年 electricity .
by the low - cost , and just get of fuel supply enough to filter the water program for the rest of the earth .
you look at the front , and there are many ways challenge , but it 's hundreds of examples of what we need to move forward .
we think , how do we measure .
we should report on them ?
let 's take a look at our goal , and then we look backwards . let 's take a look at our goal of the mid - , and look at the mid - backwards .
has a lot of people in the year 2050 减碳 80 percent .
it 's really important , we need to do this .
and that 's 20 percent of the poorest country to share some kind of agriculture , and hopefully , when we 've cleaned up in concrete and 伐木业
so , i 'm going to get 80 percent of the world , in china and the power to change their common in these countries .
another level , whether we deploy the technologies to zero , we are all in the developed world took 该项 technology and in the process of the rest to
this is very important .
it 's got the best 答卷 关键因素
back in 2050 , by 2020 , which is supposed to be ?
well , i will have two parts .
censorship and efficiency measure that we should start to reduce the amount of co 2 emissions , the less and less carbon and the temperature .
but in some ways , that we 've done some work by 2020 equivalent emissions , but it 's not a lot of hard to do it , or a low - weigh less than the other thing that is the key to the importance of innovation .
we need to be full of transcending these technologies we can use to participate , pilot program , or the number of policy measure changes .
reading about this topic , there 's a lot of good .
al gore 's " our choice , for example , " david 麦基 sustainable energy from the hot . "
and study , and they built a framework for , because we need to be talking to the problem of 广泛支持 for this .
to 多方 of collaborative
and this is a wish .
we developed this technique is a very , very specific reality .
if i could for the next 50 年许 when president or a wish , who i choose to take a vaccine , and that 's what i love my career choice about energy or the technology that will be zero 能源价格 cut in half , and i would choose energy .
this is one of the largest
if we do n't consider this wish to short - term goal and long - term , people will have a huge divergence in china , in the u.s. , will have a huge disagreement between rich and poor , and most of the poorest two billion people who will be a lot of life .
so what we need to do ?
what i implore you to move ?
we should be funded research .
at a conference like copenhagen countries need not just talking about the co 2 emissions .
should n't be talking about the these innovative ways to innovate . low stunned that makes you
we really need to the market , carbon dioxide 税费 限额 and deal with these kinds of things that price signals .
we need to put information 传出去
we ought to be able to make this more rationally , including exoteric dialogue that the government .
it 's a big wish , and i think it can make a wish .
thank you .
thank you .
interviewer : thank you .
, thank you . i 'm more Terrapower understanding , first of all , you will be talking about this is a large - scale ?
bill gates : if you buy a supercomputer , software to hire these brilliant scientists , we 've done with about a couple of russia , we went to a test our materials reactor if it 's going to work together , and it takes a billion people .
the nuclear reactor 筹措 billions of experiments , we find is this site chosen to be able to build this first manager , nuclear power plant .
when you built the first , if it 's really like to say , and everything that 's very simple , because it economically , energy density is completely different from what we 're familiar with nuclear power .
interviewer : so , i said , " this is to build a underground use this to an abandoned uranium to fuel 柱 vertical and built this abandoned uranium - fuel 柱 responses from the top 渐进 ?
the current reactor , bill gates : yeah . and you have to re - plus . so there 's a lot of causes and control , could be wrong , you need the reactor 核燃料 moved into a little bit out all be wrong , no insurance reactor , you need to open fuel moved into a little bit out all be wrong , no insurance
so , if there 's a very cheap fuel , the size of a 木柱 enough to use , 60 years , so if there 's a very cheap fuel , the size of a 木柱 enough to use it down to 60 years , not that complicated .
there was a 烧个 60 years , and we do n't .
moderator : the nuclear waste of space itself is dealing with that person
bill gates : yeah . the process of garbage , you can put it there , just to make this a little bit of a nuclear waste and you can put it on the other off , you can put it in another off in the nuclear power plant .
that we can start with the nuclear waste that are now at the reactor cooling ponds or 罐里 out of this is what we do at the beginning of the fuel .
, so that the current reactor that its ingredients , we 're going to be in trouble , but also reduce its waste , so that the reactor ingredients , we 're going to be in trouble , but also reduce its waste , so that the reactor ingredients , we 're going to be in trouble , but also reduce its waste , so that the reactor ingredients , we 're going to be in trouble , but also reduce waste .
moderator : people talking to you and elsewhere in the when it comes to these possibilities .
most people interested in doing this ?
bill gates : we do n't have chosen a particular place for all the secret of nuclear rules that a lot of people who were interested in china , india , russia , are interested in the company i used to be here talking about how to 能源部长 energy into this thing .
总地 , i 'm optimistic , and the french and some work done in japan
there is a variations .
an important , but it 's like a fast reactor in many countries have built our reactor , if you 've got very quickly , it 's going to be the first use of a nuclear reactor standing constructionists .
moderator : the possibility of time and , you realize that this project ? thank you , and it was time to plan that possible ?
bill gates : a kind of power , and to very low cost bill gates : a kind of power , and we have to very low cost , for 20 years , and then for 20 years .
is this idea that we calculate the model of the ultimate deadline is this idea that we calculate the model of the ultimate deadline
if Terrapower 一切顺利 , of course , that would be very hard , you can easily enough that if you 're going to Terrapower 一切顺利 , of course , that would be very hard , and you can easily with this .
数十家 companies and currently 几百家 if they 're doing things that we need to work out if they have the power of the funding experiment that they could compete .
if you could 多方 . that 's because it can also use of the best .
but we need to be at least a success .
moderator : if the large - scale of innovation that is , you know , maybe one of the largest
bill gates : the power of the most important thing is .
without limitations of the environment , and it would be the most important question makes it more out of the environment , more urgent .
in the field of nuclear , there are other innovators
, but i do their job , and we do n't know somebody like this project , in terms of blocks of innovation , there 's another way
reactors happen , and there 's a liquid , maybe a little bit , but they see and the way we think .
, so there are lots of different ways , but the beauty of nuclear , uranium molecule that contain a source of energy is something like the coal , a million times , but the beauty of nuclear , uranium molecule that contain a source of energy is something like the coal , a million times as if it 's good to be able to deal with the radiation , mostly negative things , if you have to be able to deal with all the major costs are 其碳 emits radiation , and the potential for the potential , and it 's going to be an 其碳 emissions , and the cost has the potential for the potential , and it 's going to be an 其碳 emissions , and the cost of potential for the potential , and it 's going to be wonderful .
so , if we do n't have to be successful ?
we need to take 紧急措施 to make sure that the earth , the temperature ?
bill gates : if you happen to step , like eating too much , that would get heart ? and you might have a heart surgery .
there is a work called " geo - engineering and all sorts of technologies to slow down for us to global warming 20 or 30 years of
well , it 's like a insurance policy .
you do n't want you to use
some people say no to study the insurance will make people 懈怠 because you 're going to continue to eat , you know , heart , you can save
about the importance of the problem is , i do n't know whether it 's about engineering on the planet should have a backup to choose , were getting faster and technological innovation , as we expect
moderator : the theory of climate change skeptics , if you were to say to them 一两句话 what you 're going to convince them ?
bill gates , unfortunately , the skeptics from different camp
they are very few of the scientific evidence .
because they say , as a result of those 负反馈 clouds , and they say , as a result of those 负反馈 because of the cloud .
they can give compelling evidence that even the tiniest probability million .
here in the major problems , like hiv / aids .
now to , in the future of suffering .
and therefore , when you 're all kinds of urgent problems suffering now about the future . and it 's an uncertain . in fact , the ipcc , it 's not the worst , and in the developed world , and they looked at the world , and said , " okay , and this is somebody who looked at the paper , and said , " well , that 's okay .
in fact , in terms of uncertainty , that we 're going to be working
my wish is to be , but if you make energy production , and the economy to limit co 2 emissions , but also , if you put energy production , my wish is to the economy , but also to limit co 2 emissions , the skeptics said , " well , i do n't care about the co 2 emissions , the skeptics said , " well , i do n't care about the co 2 emissions co 2 emissions , and i hope it 's a little bit about energy , but i 'm going to follow this new approach , because it 's cheaper than before .
energy , but i 'm going to follow this new approach , because it 's cheaper than before moderator : if we can say , this is what you compare 约恩隆 伯格 response , which means , if you spend all the energy to solve the problem of co 2 , and then the other purpose in other words , if you spend all the energy to solve the problem of co 2 , and then the other , to solve poverty in the world , or goal and to put money in those cast malaria is a waste of capital , the more important things that we have to put money in those cast , it 's a waste of capital , more important things that we have to do .
developed bill gates : actually , how much in the u.s. , and it 's not supposed to be 100 亿在 over a year into it , it 's supposed to be developed bill gates : it does n't have an effect on the other things , and how it 's not supposed to be in the u.s. , 100 亿在 over a year into it , it 's supposed to be developed bill gates : it does n't have an effect on the other things , and how it 's not supposed to be in the u.s. , 100 亿在 over a year into it , it does n't have other things .
bill gates : the r&d , the united states , and how it 's not supposed to be 100 亿在 over a year into it , it does n't have other things .
for economic 投巨资 career , if you do n't have to return to me , this is basically waste , some people might disagree skeptical about economic 投巨资 career , if you do n't have to return to me , this is basically waste , some people might disagree skeptical about economic 投巨资 career , if you do n't have to return to me , this is basically waste , some people might disagree skeptical
unless you 've been pretty close to succeed , and you 're investing in the curve , and it 's going to be very cheap , and unless you 've got to work , and you 're investing in the curve , and it 's going to be very cheap , because i think we should be 多方 potential to try to very low - cost , because i think we should try 多方 which have low - cost potential .
in order to solve the climate , and if you could only be uncompetitive very expensive , using the energy , if you have to address climate change , and i wanted to be uncompetitive very expensive , and only using the energy to .
it for you , if not 能源价格 five times , they affect our lives , you 're sitting in the way , if not 能源价格 five times , they affect our lives .
but for those two billion people on the planet is a disaster .
and the mists of that has changed , and he came to that now is , why do n't get more concerned about .
and the mists of that has changed , and he came to that now is , why do n't get more concerned about .
based on the history of the reasons , he 's a skepticism box , but he has to realize that it 's a very lonely , because he 's not based on our history 怀疑论 camp , but he has to realize that it 's a very lonely , because he 's not based on our history 怀疑论 box , but he has to realize that it 's a very lonely camp , so he started r&d in about the point of view .
i think that 's a very good address the issue of was , because the amount of scientific 不可理喻
i think that 's a very good address the issue of was , because the amount of scientific 不可理喻
interviewer : bill , i think most people here , i really want to be true , thank you very much . thank you bill , i think most people here , i really hope you true , thank you very much .
bill gates : thank you .
a few years ago , on the ted conference , and peter Skillman introduced a design challenge is “ marshmallow ”
is a very simple idea for a team of four , independent on top of a building material is a piece of tape 20 root in italy , a string of cotton candy .
to put it on the marshmallow
it 's so simple , because it 's not easy to people who are very rapidly .
and i think this is an interesting idea . i put it into a 专题讨论 design meeting
very successful .
since then , i was in the world over 70 专题讨论 in design students to architects and designers , or fortune 50 cto , in many ways that gave us the profound inspire us to work that i 'd like to share with you some
normally , people are always start talking about this task .
they talk a little , sort of what it would be like they were arguing wrong .
and spend some time to plan italian , so they draw drawings and linguine
they took out a lot of time and noodle dishes together in italy .
and then finally , to run out of their time and carefully marshmallow put on the top , and then they marshmallow , ha ha . they 're enjoying a step back .
, but mostly it 's actually happening “ haha ” becomes a bad “ ” , because the weight of the whole structure to 散架 marshmallow .
now there are some of their “ bad ” the worst of times more than a new graduate students in the business .
they lie , it 's very easy to cheat , by their 建筑构造 pretty crappy .
and of course , there 's some teams , they created more “ haha ” moment of the best , which is a new school preschool 小朋友
and this is really amazing .
as PETER told us they created the buildings , and they 're not build the structure of the most interesting .
so if you ask about what 's going on here ? what are they ?
peter kids like saying , because there 's no “ ceo of linguine ” is italian attempt to do .
they 're not fighting over right on any time .
but that 's another one .
because the students have training is to find a business plan right .
and they are planning .
and the truth is , when they put the marshmallow limited when they finished at the top of the time , and then ?
crisis that arrived .
listen to familiar , right ? that 's right .
kindergarten kids do n't like the one they start marshmallow 先建 样板 model , and then , in all the marshmallow 上加建 at the top , and they have a chance to continue to look .
and to realize that this is a collaboration with the process is very important .
version for every child will be very rapidly , ok , what they do n't know what feedback .
so that 's the real key to prototype . let 's look at how different teams .
人建 most of the average height is good business school students , it 's about 20 feet half a lawyer , but it 's not going to some kindergarten kids , better than most adults .
who is the best thing to do that ?
i 'm an engineer , and at all .
i met the tallest tower is 39 - inch
why ? because they understand triangles and self - 巩固 stabilize the structure of the geometric patterns are building
president slightly better than the average , but what 's interesting
and if you add a team in their 行政助理 they immediately became a lot of good grades .
and this is an incredible , you look around , and she said that “ 小组会 win . ”
you already know , why not ?
because they have very simple .
the process , they understand them .
anyway , any kind of a group of positive and focusing on a team of the work itself has dramatically improve
skills and good use of that particular combination of two of the success .
and if you have 10 个队 activity in this kind of six 个队 can build upright .
try i made a really interesting .
i thought , well , let 's make bet .
so i offered 10 million dollars ' worth of software to 得胜 groups .
and the students to learn how to design , you have to what ?
the consequence ?
that did n't have a group of a standing on the building .
any one group of an inch of buildings , they can be put back 捧 's bearing
so , what 's interesting is going to have a huge impact on the high fat check .
and then the students in the same way we repeated it .
how can you guess what ? "
now , they know that 做样 model of value .
so that the team groups became the best .
they use a minimum amount of time and the building .
and we have these very deep educational reveals reward and the essence of success .
and so , you might ask , " why would they spend on a marshmallow challenges .
and the reason is that i can use 电子工具 process to help people to build a car , video games and focus .
and the challenge of the marshmallow taught us that if some of the hidden
because , frankly , with their own marshmallow every project .
it provides a challenge to be able to share the experience of a common language processing universal question .
this simple exercises that you can give us the value of experience .
if you have to marshmallowchallenge website .
this is a blog and tell you how you can read the marshmallow buildings .
there 's a very specific steps .
weird example of how people from all over the world and the system .
there 's a world record
and i believe , is the most fundamental 教意 : design is actually a form of communication .
it requires that we put our all 神志 asked us to use the best in the state of the mission of our senses , to meet the challenges we face .
models , and there was a little 样板 experience of us will “ worse moment ” became “ ” haha ” moment .
that 's going to come as a result of a big difference .
thank you very much .
let 's suppose there 's a machine .
it 's a very , very , very cool . at ted , and it 's a time machine .
and everybody 's got to go to a time machine .
and you can choose to go back to the past or into the future , i ca n't stop at the moment .
i wonder what would you choose times when i asked my friends , it 's very , very recently , the answer this question , they were “ back ” .
i do n't understand , and they said , " no , no cars going back to twitter , or the " american idol .
i do n't really understand that .
and i 'm sure there is something that is nostalgic fondness or wishful thinking .
so i can also understand that .
but i must admit , and they 're not in .
i want to go back , not because i 'd like to take risks .
but on this planet , because it 's not going to get in the past , and you 're going to go into the future .
in other words , this machine , and i want to go out into the future .
the age of our time is the best way to measure , whether you , health and wealth and mobility , opportunities to decline .
never been so good .
i had my grandparents , died at the age of 60 .
my grandparents had died in the '70s .
my parents died in the '80s 20s .
i wanted to die in a number of at the beginning .
, but it 's not about who we are , because that 's bigger than our own .
a child born today , in new delhi like 100 years ago , as long as the most of the people in the world .
you think . it 's a wonderful thing .
why is it going to be the fact that ?
because the smallpox eradicated smallpox . we had a lives of millions of people on earth .
any configuration , and this is the shape of the earth 's population it ca n't compare the war .
but today that has been completely eradicated .
humanity is bound it .
just in the richer social generations ago , back to life millions of people that have almost no threat to the disease .
白喉 measles , germany , and virtually does n't exist .
you know , these names , what does it mean ?
现代医学 and human vaccine for millions of people who are capable of food , the scientific method to win .
in my view , the scientific method is to try and check , the process itself is one of the greatest that human beings .
so these are the good news .
but unfortunately , that 's the good news , because we have met a lot of other things , which was mentioned times .
one is , even though we have a tremendous progress in the world , but now there are 10 billion 吃不饱 , every day , and they 're all suffer from hunger .
this number , and still rising up speed . this is that , let 's embarrassing .
and furthermore , brought back to the human imagination . a lot of garbage .
water arable land rainforest , oil , gas , and these resources are disappearing , and it dies too fast , unless we hope to innovate , otherwise , we do n't have any .
the question is : can we do ? i think we can do it .
and i think we can produce enough food for billions of people , and not damage they depend on land .
and i think we can find 环境友好 energy to feed the world .
i really believe that this theory , this is not 臆想 .
i met , but i 'm always sleep at night . this is one of the things that allows me to sleep at night . never like here in human history need technological progress .
in history , and we 've had it like this , we can follow the willingness to use these technologies .
in many areas , and we 're standing in front of an amazing discovery . in fact , i think we need to look back before the age of 300 years ago , back to the renaissance , one of the people that have to fight , somebody has to be better than what we 're more violent resistance to advances in technology .
people are always like to put yourself in their own framework , they put yourself in the idea of 包得 dead , more often than not 脱身 .
you ca n't even heard of truth into them .
, everybody can listen to him , they could keep talking about , and the idea of progress .
but , you know , you ca n't believe in ?
you ca n't just , you know what the truth . it 's true , you ca n't .
i took a while to insight .
in the new yorker , about 10 years ago , and i wrote a story about a little story .
but i found that there are so 多人要 against them against the health of the most effective preventative in human history .
and i really do n't know how to do , and i just do a story . it , and i 'm going to do something else .
after a while , i wrote an article about genetically engineered food .
and it 's got a lot of opposition , 声浪 over time .
and this is crazy .
so i wrote an article on , and i really do n't understand why people understand that as the “ ” food , i do n't understand why people think of a certain way , rather than any way to carry the molecule is doing with nature .
but i just do it . the story , and i 'm going to do whatever it .
i 'm a journalist .
our job is to write and publish dinner , and this is our lives .
but australians are made me feel uncomfortable , because i do n't know what it was n't until later , i did n't know .
who were forced me insane in fact , it 's not fanatical mania molecules .
they are people who have thought , well - educated , integrity citizens .
they 're like the people in this room .
it makes me really upset .
and i think , to be honest .
we have today for the progress of the relationship between different down .
we are now in a very confused in our view of progress .
progress and the irony in that we 're going to talk about a quote , " “ ” progress .
and i think there 's a reason for that reason , and we know what it is .
for civil society organizations , and the government , and sometimes we have lost faith , science is there , maybe we do n't trust .
name out about a couple of reasons , you know what it is .
chernobyl , 博帕尔 challenger , whom anti - arthritis drugs , and the weapons of mass destruction , the vote - and - a - half .
i want you to put in such a list 列出来 .
we used to completely trust is always right now , it all wrong . so you have to have a little bit skeptical .
ask for a couple of questions , and the evidence .
ca n't do everything else .
but one thing to notice , when you get the evidence , you need to embrace the evidence for that , but we do n't do good .
, i think that 's why we have to fear of infectious diseases , this is an epidemic and the depth of hope , not more , i 've never had a show .
12 years ago , a news media 暴光 , which is a very scary . it 's going to be associated with autism , and get measles , 腮腺炎 风疹 vaccination together .
it was pretty scary .
so there 's a lot of research and around that event .
that have been doing this , because it 's a serious issue .
and this data out there .
sweden reviewing the data in canada , from the united states , britain , which is the same conclusion of autism and the vaccine , no , no , no contact .
, but it does n't mean too big for the public , because we like to hear that little story , we 're going to see our eyes , that we think we 're looking at the heart of the things we really think .
, but i do n't believe that a bunch of 化验 documents from government data , and i ca n't believe it can also understand that , i think we all have in our hearts .
but the consequence ?
that 's pretty .
please listen : this is the only one of the united states measles 接种 down in the country .
that 's enough to make us feel , we should be ashamed .
it 's a terrible thing .
what is to make this happen ?
now , i learned that really understand it .
here are some people have been measles , right ?
because you can see some of you get measles , and the death ?
no , no more .
in fact , it 's not going to happen in this country , but in the last year , because with 16 million people dying measles .
is basically , this is a huge number of people every two hours and die .
, but because it 's not happening all around us that the things that we can either , jenny , the people who are still to be able to spread on oprah and larry king show their fear and ignorance .
and they are doing this because there 's no reason to link together .
something that looks like they do n't know , in fact , not always the same .
we need to learn lessons from , and it 's 越早 as well .
this guy , jonas salk Salk is just a hero .
because he invented the polio vaccine allowed people to avoid the worst disaster .
now , people do n't need to be a disease , and it does n't have the disease , the pain of polio disappeared .
it 's not so 风光 man in the middle .
his name is paul offit .
he invented with several other researchers 轮状病毒 vaccines .
and every single year , he can save lives 400 million and a half a million children in the developing world .
that 's great , right ?
paul is really good . that 's going to tell people around a vaccine that said , " well , they are 并称 and people would say goodbye 苦楚 . "
and he would actually say that .
so , we 're going to paul as part of the terrorists .
and paul testified to release him , there must be the security .
at home , he got a phone threats because people are going to tell him where they do n't know where he kids to school .
why ? because paul invented a vaccine .
i do n't need to talk about this , but the vaccine is really important .
and disease and vaccination , going back , and it 's really scary diseases , it 's happening .
now , in the u.s. measles .
situation , and it gets worse , soon , we 're going to have children die from this , because it 's a number of questions .
it 's not just measles .
and polio , who 's going to say it 's not going to be ?
one of my college students a couple of weeks ago , i wrote a letter to me and she said , a little bit too 张扬 now .
people say that never before .
and she said she did n't intend to vaccinate children polio vaccine . yes .
okay .
why ? because there 's no polio in this country , but you know ?
we do n't have the epidemic yesterday .
today , i do n't know , maybe a guest from lagos on an airplane , and he 's destination is l.a. airport , and now to ohio .
after a few hours , he came to the ground , and he 打车 here in long beach , participating in a dinner party here at ted .
he did n't know they 're infected with polio in the world , we do n't know , that 's true .
that 's the truth . do n't think of our planet is not .
we like to believe that lies . we all love to do it .
everybody in the morning you ate vitamins . right ?
, or 紫锥花 抗氧化剂 , just a little bit fed the feeling that you 're awake .
you do that , because every half of the american people are doing .
they 're going to eat something like this , it will take the drugs , despite the fact that we already know this stuff is really ineffectual . "
data is to say .
they are just making urine . and you put that aside . they ca n't afford anything .
if you want to get some black 280 dollars spent urine .
i do n't know .
it 's black , black , urine .
why ? why are you doing ?
i thought i might be able to understand the pharmaceutical industry , very large in this country .
and we all hate governments , because in that people do n't trust .
but we do n't have to do our healthcare system .
for millions of citizens , which is a system .
and so , for people to be able to pay for it . this is absolutely grim and a kind of health care system .
so we managed to escape from this system , to stay where ?
we have invested placebo tremendous force .
" oh , i love this wonderful placebo .
but you know , so it 's a serious because this is a payoff , but we 've 却花 破烂货 millions to buy a placebo .
i gave samples of here .
none of them is the work , whether it 's 银杏果 紫锥花 阿薩伊果 , are the trojan horse . i do n't even know what it is , but we have spent billions of payoff to buy them , and that 's wrong .
but , you know , when i was talking about here ? people screaming . they would say to me , “ tube 闲事 ! what you get people to do it !
take a placebo , at least make people feel comfort inside ! "
you know ? you 're wrong .
. i 'm not going to within the minister of the american public health and 事业部 said , " if “ experts that does n't matter what i find evidence of mammograms now ? " -- this is a cancer or treated by the coffee enema 庸医 think of his patients .
and if you believe that the magic you end up with the scientific evidence , rather than just to a place where you do n't want to go .
and you might be a leader , thabo .
he insisted that 甜菜 柠檬油 than we do n't slow down and 根蒜 antiretroviral drugs to treat hiv prevalence of hiv and that led to more effective 40 million people die of aids .
tens of thousands of people dying of unnecessary die , and that 's part of the world 's most infected with hiv / aids .
please tell me that all these cases is not a 严重后果 .
that is , there 's always .
ignorance , and now we have the disease is 精耕 genetically engineered crops and organic food , between the two camps , stupid .
and this is a stupid arguing that we have to stop the argument .
because just argue that the metaphor .
arguing about ideology , and it 's not just about science argument .
we 吃进 in every single thing , and every one of the belly , every single 香菜 每根 布鲁塞尔 豆芽 used by humans .
because in the garden of eden , it 's not the orange .
there 's no 哈密瓜 .
does n't even have a christmas tree . it 's all - out .
the last 一万一千 created these things .
there are some succeeded , and some experiments failed .
the failed attempts at being discarded .
and now we can be more precise way to do . there must be at risk . but we can put vitamin a rice , genes , it 's going to save millions of people , or their life extension of life .
you do n't want to do this work ?
and i said , " i do n't understand it .
we have a lot of people who are genetically engineered food .
why ?
i hear a lot of reasons why is this : the chemistry is too much , much genetically engineered food industry , hormonal 单一化 production , but we do n't want to 数百亩 . that 's exactly the same crop production , and that 's not .
and we do n't want to new patent on food companies .
and we do n't want to corporations monopoly seeds .
i suspect that you can respond to these objections . right ?
well , guess what , let 's come together to solve these problems .
well , we had a very big food problem , but that 's not the problem of science .
because it 's not and science .
this is a legal and ethical , patent law - related issues .
you know , it 's not science company .
and it 's not a country .
it 's not even an idea , and it 's a process .
that sometimes successful , fail , but because we fear and scientists do n't think we should be allowed to do it and get paid to do is a very scary , and it 's too slow the flow of millions of people to prosperity .
the next 50 years ago , we need to grow more than 70 percent of the food .
that 's what we 're in the last 30 years in total .
it 's very embarrassing .
from this , but now we do n't need to give us .
why ? because genetically engineered food .
we do n't really encouraging people to go wrong , food , like the conditions of tapioca .
in the world 's 5,000 people are living on the tapioca .
and that 's potatoes , like a kind of food .
it 's only calories , taste good .
no nutrition , and proteins , scientists are trying to put them into the tapioca .
to these people over modification cassava they eat it can be avoided .
not to starve , you know ,
this is a good thing . restaurant manager , though , but it 's also good .
and i said , " why people are against this ?
and i want you to ask myself the question : why we need to take ?
because we do n't want to move the genome ?
this is just moved to add some of the genome , there 's no chemicals .
hormone , and there 's no relationship to food . we 're always wanted to get bigger and bigger , better food , but the other .
it 's not 酥 要造 meters , just to make some people , and it 's the process , we really understand what it means .
you know ?
if we do n't do that , but now , we 're going to do , because some of the things we do n't want to happen , and that 's going to be high - tech colonialism and guilt .
there 's no more fitting in other words to describe this situation .
this selfish , dirty , they 're doing it would reduce our dignity , we have to stop doing it .
okay , so it was a very interesting conversations “ , and then you might say , you 've got to go into this 一时间 machine , and the future 驶向 ” ?
and of course , i would do that .
this machine right now in the present , but we have a great opportunity .
and we can 如愿 any time machine .
where you want to go there , we can go back to what we really want to go to places .
we need to do this , we need to think , when we went to a time machine , and 驶向 choices , and we would do in the future .
and i think , i believe we can understand , and that 's what the world needs now .
thank you very much . so ...
thank you .
so .
in a while i was interested in a placebo , usually a magician . it 's not a placebo . but if you 're interested in looking from the standpoint of my career , which is to make something a real , to make sure that they become reality .
糖片 in other words , and we can measure the impact of studies , called the placebo effect is because they think they 're going to happen to 镇痛 or a drug is going to give you an example , if you believe that the patient who was a drug 镇痛 , obviously , there will be in the . it 's called the placebo effect .
into something that is a real fake -- because the perception of it .
we 're going to be able to understand each other , and i want to show you a primary magic , very simple .
and i 'm going to tell you how it becomes . it 's a start in the '50s , every child in the magic tricks .
in the 1970s , when i 've learned since scout magic , it 's
so i 'm going to do , and then i 'm going to show you .
and i 'm going to explain why i 'm going to explain .
now , how is that the magic .
the knife , and you can check out my hands ; you can also .
and so i put 刀握 in my fists . "
and then i took my sleeve 挽 .
and to make sure that you can do nothing in my sleeve up and down . i like that , in this 压住 the wrist .
and you can see that there 's no time for anything . i just 压住 nothing can be my sleeve up here .
this is pretty simple .
and i 'm going to turn my hands , and hopefully , if all the things that the magnet physiology , and i 'll stick to the knife .
in fact , i can even dumped 粘得 tight . it 's the knife , you wo n't get rid of it .
there 's nothing in my sleeve , there 's no trickery . you can look at everything .
okay .
i -- well , it 's a lot to teach the kids who are interested in the magic tricks , because you can learn a lot about deception magic trick by learning -- even though it 's a very simple way of magic .
it 's probably a lot of people who live all know the magic .
this is what happens .
i hold the knife .
i said , " i want to hold my wrist to make sure that there 's nothing in my sleeve , and this is a lie .
that is the reason i grab the wrist , a secret .
and in my hand for you to move with the index finger , finger , finger , i will shifting from here , in this position toward 外侧 .
okay .
so many people are sitting there , it has no childhood .
and my fingers , this is the from here , right ?
and i move my hand , in my fingers .
vulnerable we can talk about why this is why you do n't notice that there are only three fingers down here , because your mind , and the way we deal with that , it 's not one , two , three . it 's a combination of them .
but it 's not that we 're going to talk about today . right ? i opened my hands .
obviously , it was in the press , not by what , but through physiologic magnetic index of deception , and i was there .
and 合上 my fingers , as i later , the motion , which is kind of the cycles of my fingers .
我拿开 's hand , and you get this kind of flicked it .
the tricks , you can do to your friends and neighbors . thank you very much .
now , and this is a placebo potent ? "
and i read about a year ago , and that 's really opened my research .
so i 'm not a doctor or a researcher , for me , this is a very surprising .
it says , " if you give people a placebo in the form of the white pills , like the aspirin , if this is a circle of white pills , there 's some of the placebo effect .
but if you change the shape of the placebo , for example , you put it into smaller , written in the blue pill , and a letter , that 's going to have more clearly measurable .
even without any real in two drugs are -- they 糖片 .
the white pills , but it 's not good blue .
what ? it 's really , to me .
but in fact , it 's not the end of the world .
if you use the capsule , they have more than any kind of pills .
and the other side of the capsule , the yellow color , the red , white capsules more effective .
a dose play a role .
no 三片 twice a day , a piece of statistics . ok . now , i know i 'm sorry .
but the point is .
and a dose drugs .
and drugs and form .
if you want to the limits of placebo , you need to inject 针剂 .
a syringe contains two , right ? do n't work , you injected it into a patient .
in their head , and it 's such a powerful imagine , it needs to be much more perceptive than the white pills .
it 's a very strong , and i had a slide that i can show you the statistics .
the point is , the white pills capsules blue pill , no , no , no 针好 . "
they do n't have really drugs . this is just what you believe that it 's true in your body , and more .
i want to see if i can take this idea that we can apply it to the magic tricks .
with something that is obviously a trick that it looks like it 's true .
we know from working 实际效果 注射针 with you , if you want .
this is a cap 七寸 pins . it 's very sharp . i 'm going to just 消 poison .
this is my muscles , it 's not 戴米安 特买肉 .
this is my skin . it 's not a hollywood effect .
i 'm going to be 刺入 by my side to it through the skin .
if you want to stress 反胃 -- if you 're likely to 晕 yesterday -- and i had some friends to play in hotels , some of the people i do n't know , there 's a woman came from .
and so , i would suggest , refer to you if you look away . in fact , in the next 30 seconds , you know , i 'm going to do it behind the beginning of the bad .
you can see , you 'll see elsewhere , and if you want to .
well , that 's happened , right here i 皮肉 起点处 my arm below , and i was a little passes .
sorry . i got to tell you , right ?
and through my skin out on the other a little bit like this .
now , we basically knives and tricks on the same place .
so much .
but now , you ca n't mention my fingers , right ?
so , let me bring them to show you one , two , three , four , five .
, " oh yeah .
and i know what people think about when they see this .
“ and they said , " oh , he wo n't be turned impale its own entertainment . we have a couple of minutes ” skin .
so , let me give you a little peek .
it looks like that ? ok .
yeah , i knew
“ behind these kinds of people say , " ok . i do n't really see the “
now in this room who can 移近 , at a distance .
let me give you just look at this .
this is one of my skin . it 's not really hollywood effect .
i was meat , and i can rotate it .
if you feel disgust , sorry . look away at this .
or from a few years later in the back of the people in this video “ would say , wow , that it looks like some kind of work , but if you will see that there 's a hole , and that 's a hole , and if it would be no .
so let me 流点 blood for you .
yes , it is .
so , normally when i 'm going to take the needle .
washed my arm , and i 'm going to show you what i did n't hurt .
in this case , but i think , 使假 becomes really things with this idea , i 'm going to stop here , over the next stage .
within a few days later , i 'll meet you .
and i hope that you would expect . thank you very much .
now you 're all talking about happiness .
people in the past five years , i just mentioned in recent years has more in a book called ” “ happiness , and they count about 40 , and there are more 没数 books .
the researchers are starting to more interested in , this issue .
and there 's a lot of joy “ coach ” teaching .
so people happier , is their goal .
但现 多如牛毛 , kind of work , there are a couple of the camera trap , insight to add to the level of happiness .
i 'm going to talk about the these cognitive trap .
these trap 既会 观感 affect the average person has been happiness , and it 's going to affect the judging the happy , because 人无完人 , we 're going to go wrong .
the trouble is willing to admit that complexity of happiness .
it turns out that the word " happiness is not use the word , because we 're 已用 其来 that a lot of things .
and i think we should limit , but basically , it means we 've got to get rid of this idea , and more complex view of what happiness .
and memory , the camera is experience mixed : that 's basically happiness and feel happy life experience in our lives and the difference between the good for your life .
these are lumped together , and the talks from the meaning of happiness .
trap focused on the third illusions , in any case , unfortunately , when we think about life , the 势必会 , when we think it 's particularly important .
i mean , this is a real understanding trap .
it 's 避 避 .
now , i 'd like to start with an example of a man 上过 in my class in 答问 之时 i told a story . [ unclear ] -- and he said he was once in a symphony , that was told , but really playing music , but at the sharp end of the mayhem .
and then he really excited about this is a mouse is bad to mess it up .
but it 's not true .
what happens , which is just for the memory of this experience .
he had this experience .
and he went through the auditory 盛会 20 minutes .
but now we have a little memory , because he 's just leave ; it 's bad memory , and the other 20 minutes of launching a completely forgotten .
it tells us that when we think of ourselves and others , spent two selves .
this one 's self , for the first experience to seize the insights , today , it 's also the past , but basically , he just present .
doctors usually is the experience of self - to - like doctors , and when i ask you , “ you touch it here ? ” .
another self is a memory , he 's in charge of life lived 抒写 story , and they 're going to pick up that when he was going to ask , how does it feel recently “ ” ?
or to albania “ ? ” waiting for that kind of fun .
self and memory is a very different from the mix is that we do n't know , it 's not part of happiness .
remember the stories .
stories from the memory of - a - posted in real time .
it 's not that we 're talking about what we 're going to tell a story .
memories are stored in , and it 's a story from our experience of the story .
let me start with an example .
it 's an age - old .
some of the real pain patients who are going to adopt a therapy .
so little capitals . no , no longer today sick , but in the 1990s , that 's ways .
every patient in six seconds to report on their pain .
here 's two patients . that 's what they record .
i ask you “ among them , who is the most painful ” ?
this is pretty simple .
patients are b. he colonoscopy , of course , long time , a sense of 痛疼 minute patients , and b , and feel for longer .
but now there 's another question : what people think they are suffering ?
there 's a little surprising .
the amazing thing is a patient colonoscopy , even worse than the patient .
two colonoscopy , -- the end of the story , which is different .
and two stories are very smart -- but there 's obviously a lot of different ...
it 's one of these feel bad than another .
and -- and this is a terrible at the end of the time who understand what is the 痛绝 寰 . it 's not a good story .
how do we know what ? "
after the screening , because we asked them , and they ask for a long time , and then again , the whole idea of colonoscopy “ you how ” ?
it turns out that there 's a memory , and obviously , or even worse than that .
now , this is a direct collision of self and memory and experience .
from the perspective of self - experience , b is obviously sick .
so a patient , how do we actually made a clinical trial , when you do an experiment , we 've got the expected outcome of patients , in fact , we can get a vibration and shoved down through time .
while still painful , but it has a lot of the patient .
continue like that , if you 're going to bring the experience of a sense of self - worse , whereas the memory of a self - patients feel better , because you 've given you a story of a good thing , a little bit better threat of his story .
stories about how to define 好坏 ?
story is the actual memory and tell us the stories , and it 's true .
and 时分 orgasm in the end of story .
on the end is very important , is dominated by the end of this story .
now , the experience of the self - life .
and he had a experiences , one .
you 're going to ask : what 's wrong with these “ for a moment ” ?
it 's a simple solution . they 've gone forever .
most of our lives -- i 'm a 算了算 psychology -- from the perspective of just three seconds long , and that means that person 's life is about a 六亿 . a month in the roughly 六十万个 for a moment , and they 're mostly without leaving traces .
most of whom are fully self - memory largely ignored .
now , but you also have some kind of be stored in the experience , because we 're 每分 together and make up our second life .
if we live , we 'll use these resources .
how to use them , and it is important , but it 's not a memory of the story with us .
and memory difference between self and experience is good .
the difference between them is the time .
in terms of the experience of self , if you have a holiday 第二周 第一周 equally happy , and then two weeks , cross - week vacation is twice as many of happiness .
and the memory is that it 's not a self - .
memory , how much older , two holidays self - week vacation , because it was n't in any new memory .
the story 如旧 scenarios .
memory self and experience , and it 's a distinction between the impact of this story is not a big time .
and memories of self - assembly is not tell stories .
decisions , and it 's true , because the patients , and if you 've had two types of the surgeon to perform a 镜检查 , and they decided to move now from the person to re - examine the patient , to do the memory is going to be a better sense of the doctors , and this is how we selected .
the choice is doing self - 无从置喙 experience .
in fact , we 're not going to do in these experiences . we 're in two different experiences memory make that choice .
and when we think the future , we do n't usually in the form of experience .
in the future we envision the memory of form .
basically , you can see memories of authoritarian , you can imagine self in dragging experience , and he 's going through the experience of self - do dragging experience of self .
and i had an idea , and when we tend to 放假 放假 , there 's a big part for themselves .
and i think it 's kind of 难来 dialectical .
we use the memory of ?
this can be self - explaining how to be self - memory .
it reminds me of a vacation , a few years ago , in the south pole spend holidays , this is one of my best vacation , relative to other vacation , and i often think of the vacation .
this journey 记忆量 used up to me about three weeks , in the last four years ago , it 's only about 25 minutes .
now , as i opened up about 600 资料夹 inside of an hour , i could take photographs of memories .
three weeks , with the most - and - a - half hours to recall the journey .
it seems 不成比例 .
a little bit with me , because i think it was missing , but if you think there will be more practical . why do we use a memory , more than on experience ?
so , i hope you think about a thought experiment .
if your next vacation , you know , after the holidays holidays in all of these photographs destroyed , and you can swallow pill a forgotten to everything you 've forgotten .
so , you would ever thought about the holidays ?
if you pick up a vacation , you will generate conflict between the two selves , the ideas that you 've got to this conflict , and it 's not easy , because if you just look at the time you 're going to get an answer . but if you just look at the memory , you get another one .
why do we 选此 彼 rather than the question is , which is that we need to make choices between two selves .
now , two selves , two different view of happiness .
both of belief in the two selves of happiness .
so , what you 're going to ask : there 's a self - “ experience pleasure ” ?
and then you 're going to ask : “ self - moment experience how happy they are ” ?
this moment of happiness is incredibly complicated process .
how to measure the emotions ? "
by the way , we 're going to experience and it 's self - over time , had a sense of it .
and the memory of happiness is a complete animal .
it 's not a person 's life in terms of how happy .
it for our own lives with more and more like a problem .
迥然不同 insight .
if you ca n't tell the difference between these two insight . it wo n't 参透 happiness , and the other students as well , i 've been working for this reason , which is 不透 happiness .
in recent years , the experience of joy and self - fulfilling 已能 to all of our memory , now to 测度 both .
recent gallup organization in the world had a poll , over half a million people were asking a question of , and that 's how they 're looking at their lives and how they experience , but the question , and the company did a survey .
in recent years , we tend to get information about two types of happiness .
i think we 've learned is that there are 天壤之别 .
and you can tell if people live in a happy , but it ca n't tell you how happy they are alive , and vice versa .
just to give you one of the basic idea is , between them about 50 percent .
is that when you saw a man , " my dad had 六尺 told him , you can have more than that ?
well , you might be a basic , but not really sure .
you ca n't get the judgment .
if i say , given our quality of life , and he 's about eight or 10 percent , you ca n't get them how happy self .
so , it 's very low .
what we know how to be able to make people happy satisfied .
we know that money is very important , the goal is very important .
we know that needs to be happy with the people we love to spend time with them , and it 's needs in this content .
even though there are other things , but this is the key factors .
so if you want to make two selves are happy , and you 've got to abandon 旧习 to do something completely different .
i mean , we at least not as good lazy , happiness .
these are 天壤之别 .
now , very quickly , another reason we ca n't understand the nature of happiness , and that 's how we live life and how do we have a look at different .
so , when you ask people in california , and how happy they are , you wo n't be able to get the right answer .
because when you 加州人 问时 , and you think it must be pretty fun , and you 're living in ohio .
when you think about how happy they are living in california , and you would expect , california , like all of those and other 州域 climate .
weather conditions , it turns out that does n't matter , and self - ourselves to think about how happy they are n't really matter .
reality , but now , some people might self - dominated by thinking about this one , which was moved to california .
they moved to california in order to make more pleasant life , and you can see , they will follow - up , it 's really interesting thing .
they experience of my self is not going to be happier .
and we all know .
and then when that happens , they feel how happy , because they 're thinking , they do n't remember ohio 坏天气 . and so they think they 're made the decision .
so hard to understand how happy life , i hope i 've got to give you a very basic , and how hard on this process .
thank you very much .
chris anderson : thank you . i think there 's a question to you .
thank you very much .
a few weeks ago , we had a phone call from communication , when you talk about the gallup poll that was a really interesting phenomenon .
so we can tell you about that ? we have a matter of minutes .
daniel 卡纳曼 : okay .
from the gallup poll i found a very interesting , but you can see it 实属 accident .
we found a self - on experience of happiness .
is that people will feel the income , and how much of it .
for less 60,000 dollars a year in the united states , and it turns out , and this is a sample of a large part of a 六十万 people , is really quite an indicator of the income , and these people are less than 60 dollars ...
so : 60,000 dollars .
卡纳曼 : 60,000 dollars .
60,000 dollars a year 's unhappy , and the income , and they are n't happy .
whereas when over 60,000 income , we get a horizontal line .
this incredible to see flat line .
so clearly self - experience that ca n't buy happiness , but it gives you ca n't afford to bring the situation , and we know 地测 悲郁 a level of pain , it 's very clear .
for another self , your memories , and you 've got a 大相迳庭 . "
you can make more money , you 're more comfortable .
there 's no relationship with this .
andersen : but danny , and life , and the pursuit of happiness is free of all americans .
if you take this discovery , well , this is going to turn our innate concept , for example , 课税 policy .
the politicians would be possible in this country at such a discovery , and 施政 ? "
卡纳曼 : i think there are people understand that in the position of policy 谋划 happiness .
cognitive propagating is 颇慢 in the united states , but this is in the u.k. , of course , but it was the fermentation , other countries remains .
people began to understand the general 谋划 considering a policy , or to happiness .
and even though it 's going to time , but people 's going to start thinking about it . they 're going to experience , or the pleasant life , and so pretty soon , we 're going to understand the problem .
how fields , there are several ways , but , you 're thinking about how you want to experience the memory , or to self - self .
within a couple of years , i think it 's going to influence policy .
the united states has been a huge effort to measure the experience of happiness .
and i 'd like to within a decade or two countries , and this is going to be part of the data .
so for me , this is going to be in the next few years from a policy agenda .
thank you very much the creation of behavioral economics .
thank you very much daniel 卡纳曼 .
i 'm a game designer , my name is JaneMcGonigal
i 've been online for 10 years , the next 10 years that i wanted to make it easy solutions like playing a game in real life .
now , i 'm going to explain why i say , well , because if people are larger and more good games , of course , in this room , and you can spend more time in the game that i have to explain to you .
where people can take a look at the time in the game 30 billion hours per week where people can take a look at the time in the game 30 billion hours per week
some of you may think that “ spent more time playing ” .
maybe a little bit more to life , because there 's a lot of urgent question we need to deal with
in the future , but according to me questions about research , we spend on the video games do n't .
every 30 million hours of video games for solve the problem of life in the far less than a week 30 million hours of video games for solve the problem of life in the way .
and in fact , i think it 's better to survive on planet earth , in fact , i think it 's better to survive on earth , we need a lot more time .
i 've ever done , what we need to do in the game 210 billion hours per week
maybe some violate the common sense , but i want to say that again , in order to make this idea is that if we want to solve the climate change , like the poverty and hunger and global strife and obesity and i believe we need to be encouraging people to play a game , and at least 210 billion hours a week after 10 years ago , of course , it 's going to
in fact , i was really serious , it 's not a joke .
here is that , and the reason we put this together , which is a scene of the human race is really important to live in the future .
this is a photograph by the phil Toldano portraits .
changes , and he wanted to play a game of emotions , and he put photography device is playing a game .
this is a gamer classic .
now , if you do n't you wo n't be aware that 's a video game players in the picture .
pressing , you might feel a bit of fear , instead of concentration , or are we going to focus on solving a problem .
if you 're a game , you 'll feel like something different wrinkles around the corner of the upward , including 嘴角 褶皱 around the same is true of evidence that this is a very optimistic 眉毛 翘起 up , and it 's amazing .
this game , that 's going on in this game epic triumph , wonderful 如诗般 巨大胜利 , get an to win .
now you 've heard about this word , gamers that some of you are .
this epic . it 's a result , but it 's very exciting , to get this before you could n't even think about how successful .
this is a success , you ca n't even imagine
and once you reach out and you would have been struck by their own capabilities , this is what we call the triumph of “ epic ”
and this person is going to get this .
and , of which is , what we want to deal with many obstacles out of the problems of the world can 排除万难 are expressions of 无往不胜 .
now , unfortunately , when we deal with our daily lives of emergency , we tend to look at this .
and i call this “ ” expressions are actually making my own life was not very good at this , and you can see from the ? ok .
this is the ” “ , not very good at making my life .
i in berkeley , california , which is one of the old graffiti . i was a ph.d. in a community , and i read a ph.d. in research , which is why we think of virtual worlds “ better than the real world ”
and this is a lot of action games .
we ca n't feel like in the video games for life .
i do n't think that is used to work , and it 's not worth 纵然 adaptive is part of success .
we do in the world of the game with the adapt more successful , but here 's what to do something 紧要 intrinsic motivation , with the idea of collaboration .
when we think in the world , and i think we can do the best and to see a message that we 're going to help each other and progress to solve a problem in the face of frustration , and we 're going to courageously stand still .
, but when we failed in real life , when we had a barrier , and we wo n't feel so often .
we tend to think very depressing anxiety and depression , what , what 灰心 or a cynical
and that 's when we do n't feel when the game , it does n't exist in the game .
that was my graduate students , looking at something that is when i was reading graduate studies .
if we could make us feel anything , do n't play is not going to happen ?
how do we get from games like that to happen in social work ?
as a result , i 've been working on some games that are like " world of warcraft ideal to solve the problems of collaborative consumption .
i noticed that there are things that these things could make epic triumph of in the game .
the first thing is , whenever you in this game , especially in the world of warcraft " game , and they would have a lot of different roles , and you can trust you would help to save the world .
but it 's not all the task , and those are just the task of exactly match your
so , you have the ability to it .
and not going to give you a , you ca n't do the ability to the task .
the limits of , but you need to be able to do this task , and therefore , you 've got to get the best in the world of warcraft , everybody has its own position .
there 's no -- there was something very important and waiting for you to accomplish .
and games in the world has a lot of people can work together .
whether you up , there are tens of thousands of people waiting for you to do with those and huge herculean task .
in real life , it 's not that easy that feeling of hundreds of thousands of partnerships between at our fingertips in real life , it 's not that simple .
in this game , and there 's a beautiful , the plot of attracted a lot of us , and what motivates us .
and at the same time , and what we 're going to try to make any of you have a positive for sure .
you 've heard of , with strength increases in order to add a little bit of time , or
in real life , and we have this constant feedback .
, for example , when i was walking down the stage , i do n't have the ability to speak 加一 crazy , crazy ideas 加一 to even creative capacities and 20 .
in real life , i do n't have any reward .
on the web 虚拟环境 , for example , in the world of warcraft " 虚拟环境 network , for example , in the world of warcraft " collaboration with other people are very 惬意 thing , because we can to keep to the end , and that 's why are we going to have been 沉醉于 worlds .
because it 's better than a reality .
up until now , the " world of warcraft gamers have spent the 593 for years in time to solve 艾泽拉斯 virtual to solve the problem of 艾泽拉斯 inside of a problem .
it 's not necessarily a bad thing .
but it sounds like a bad thing .
we 're going to write these numbers , 593 primates human ancestors 10,000 years ago , we started walking upright
this is the first upright - walking primate
when we 're talking about , and we spent so much time on the video games , the only legitimate way to do is to think about what we 're spending time in human evolution . how many people , and that 's an extraordinary thing .
to think about this is the appropriate , because you 'll notice that we spend a lot of time to play a game we can change the way we can change our ability to 做人 做人 .
and we 're going to be a is a collaboration with more robust species .
and i am convinced , it 's true .
and looked at an interesting survey is made from a carnegie mellon , a researcher in the game . very young people today , in a game , young people today in the atmosphere and countries 21 years ago , the average person on the game up to 10,000 hours .
now , 10,000 hours of value is an interesting because there are two main reasons why .
from fifth high school kids in the united states , first of all , we need a good time is 10080 hours , of course , you 've got to show you the class , the attendance .
education , we have a parallel to follow the data , and it says , " the gamers of young people are doing a great amount of time with them in school , the amount of time learning as much .
some of you would read the book " the outsider MalcomGladwell . "
so you 're the theory that insight , which means not to 10,000 hours of the laws of success .
this principle is based on the cognitive research , if we could spend 10,000 hours before the age of 21 , trying to learn to do other things , or what we can get hit on these things are
we 're going to what we need to do anything in the world .
now , what we 're looking at the game for young generation .
the biggest problem is that these gamer “ at what ” ?
if we can give you the answer would be an unprecedented listener human capital .
that 's what we have to spend the day , at least one hour playing a game in the video game players .
they were 技艺 virtuoso game of five million people who are good at certain things .
in the next 10 years of 10 million people in a new field of gamers 擅长于
if , so let me tell you , which is this thing .
games industry has been the development of today , it 's 低能耗 from broadband internet and wireless networks of gamers to change the world , cell phones from india and china , especially in the players in the same , the rodeo .
据预测 in the next 10 years ago , there will be 10 billion of the players to join them .
there , we 're going to be 15 亿之众 game .
so , i started thinking about the early where video games are going to carry us ?
and i think there are four in the first is for positive state , an emergency optimistic .
you can imagine it into the self - motivated
急切 optimism is a combination of their 必胜信念 desire for that problem .
gamers still believe that wo n't be done , and it 's possible .
gamers are not alone .
they 're very good at a highly social structure .
an interesting research shows that we prefer the game with people , even though they beat , i was so
during the game , which is why we of trust , which is why we 're in the course of the game of trust .
and the reason we trust , and that 's because they took the same time , the rules has a common goal , we 're going to - shoulder , up until the game is over .
based on the video games , in fact , we can build with that , and the trust and collaboration .
moreover , we 're going to set up a little bit more robust social networks .
productivity , and i was very fond of this of happiness .
" world of warcraft , cost 22 hours a week , the average player games , like a part of the reasons .
is because when we play a game , as opposed to play , or for the shopping , we 're going to play games 加倍努力 , let 's get happier .
as humans , we prefer to do that , although it 's hard work , but even more interesting things .
if you have to be able to provide a task of a gamer , they 'll keep constantly trying to play .
and then finally , the epic .
players love to play in 威严 of those stories about our star .
any of you can do a little bit of trivia becomes part of a good idea . and that you 've all heard of , wikipedia , the largest wiki wiki on the internet , which is open , that many people together to create the hypertext system .
the second largest , which is the wiki in the world of warcraft 8 million article about a wiki . "
500 million people in every month using it .
inside of the world of warcraft " on the web of information than any other themes of information .
it 's created a epic .
and also the creation of a world of warcraft " just like a epic immense resources .
and it 's four superpowers to focus on the one thing that 's an example of this action video game players are hyper - righteous , a group of hope .
they thought that they thought their ability to change the world has the ability to change the world .
but the problem is that they believe that can change the world , not the virtual world
that 's what i 'm trying to solve the problem .
a economists called edward Castronova .
he was quite extraordinary . he 's working people spend so much time and energy and resources in a game .
he said , " “ , we 're seeing a lot of people busy ” of virtual game and
because he was an economist , so is rational .
and he said that ...
like , i was a game designer , i was full of energy
and then he said , " because video game players in the virtual game became more things get more than the real world .
in the game , they could have better than real social players could get better than real achievement and reward .
as a result , and he says , " for gamers to spend more time than in the space , more in the society .
now , i still think that it 's rational
but anyway , it 's not the best option .
now , we have to start to happen to build a society .
and so , i 'm going to happen in the inspiration from 25 years ago .
and these are the oldest dice , made by a joint of bone .
before we designed game controller we already have created a joint dice .
and this is the design of the earliest humans play instruments
if you 're familiar with the greek historian kind of like a greek historian 希罗多德 , you 'll see what 's the history of the history of the invention of the game , and the reason is that ?
希罗多德 , games , especially dice by western , Lydia minor wealthy 古国 kingdom , in a big famine .
in history , of course , that there was a massive famines king Lydia decided to do something that they had to do that .
and each other people suffering , fighting
very crisis . they need to be an extreme forms of solutions .
according to 希罗多德 , and they invented the dice game in a country of policy and one day , all of us can eat all day , but only video games .
play dice games , very attractive people 's attention , so we can bring in the welfare of self - fulfilling “ ” in production , people will forget the fact that they had no food to eat .
the people will pass through the next day they 'll play video games to eat .
according to the 希罗多德 says is lydia is spent 18 years with this way to eat , one playing video games . well , one of the way they spent famine .
that 's where we how video games .
we 're going to play a game of escape .
through games for us to avoid the physical environment , and things that you would n't satisfying 残缺不全 to get out of what we need .
and this can be achieved inexhaustible
it 's very excited .
according to 希罗多德 所著 18 years later , the holodomor , there 's no sign of a better and better , so people to the king last play dice .
he took the average person into two groups .
they play with a risky dice video games to embark on one side of the expedition .
Lydia to find a new place where they 're going to move away from the left of the people who can use existing resources left with famine shouldered the burden of spread civilization , 兴旺
it sounds crazy , is n't it ?
recently , but dna evidence of our ancestors -- 罗马帝国 伊楚 利亚人 Etruscans -- and 古利 and Lydians 迪亚人 and have the same genetic .
scientists have recently discovered 希罗多德 historically 确有其事 crazy story .
geologists have to find evidence that there was a planet 过长 of global cool for 20 years , we can explain this out of this great famine .
so , this seemingly crazy story 兴许 really
them through games for their culture , and in a game to avoid for 18 years ago , and eventually they get down 参悟 how to bring people together through games , and through this saved the whole civilization .
and we can use this way .
people are playing 魔兽 since 1994 .
this world of warcraft first live in a series of strategic game , and it 's 16 years ago .
the play dice with video games for 18 years ago , we are 16 years of warcraft
so , we 're ready to take in a way to change the way that we live in a very epic . game .
in the world is half of the civilization - looking for , and we are now 周长达 every time 210 million hours of video games .
and let 's half the people in the game day until we can go to an hour in real life .
“ you might ask , how we 're in a game ” in the real world problem ? that 's what i 've spent the last few years into the reason i work in the positive ” “ place called the institute of my work .
that we gave it a product in the office about how we think about the future .
we 're not going to try to predict the future .
, but we 're going to create the future .
we 've been thinking about the best , and it turns out that idea , we 'd like to try to get people to become a reality .
we also triumph of epics for people to win .
i want to show you a little game 三款 introduced me to do is they are , and try to give the people who can create your own epic , with some way .
this is the 无油 in the world . "
with this building in 2007 .

google has 17 who participated in 2007 , the test , we follow those people over the next three years of life .
and i can tell you is that it 's a very experience of retrofits .
nobody wanted to change their lives , or 无损 because they think about the environment , because they thought it
but if you put them in an amazing experience , and tell them , we have “ oil impoverishing our ”
this is a wonderful you hear stories of amazing experience .
challenge yourself , how are you going to see a lot of gamers to keep them in a game of a lot of gamers to keep them in a game .
in the next video games to save the world , we choose the shortage , it gets harder than oil .
we “ ” institute in the future we made a game called " Superstruct institute in the future “ ” made a game called " Superstruct
this hypothesis is , a supercomputer calculated that the only 23 years of life on earth .
this system will supercomputers called " the world .
people who are in a game , like jerry brook 海默 in the movie .
jerry . you know , brook 海默 movie , you have a 梦之队 精悍 小分队 , your 小分队 astronauts and scientists , once in a group of some of their capable to save the world .
in the game that we design , of course , we do n't have time to 五人 model , we made a team that everybody can be part of the elite 小分队 your job is to develop our energy future safe and food and health care system , and the whole network of social security .
we 8,000 people play this game , there are eight weeks .
they came up with a 500 crazy , but very creative solutions , if you can go to google #atlgas " Superstruct , and you can see .
and we 're going to play a march 三日 on it . this is a collaboration with the world bank .
if you can do this game , you 're going to get at the world bank , as a society 2010 olympiad innovators
working with sub - saharan africa 's indigenous people at the university of social innovation that we 're invited them of learning .
more like a cartoon of the game . we have a novel , about the skills , like a network of perspective , knowledge and foresight and sustainable witted , etc.
apologizing to you . i can tell young people in this game in the world , especially those in the developing world , where the game , you can bring people together and they start to think of their own social enterprise to save the world , people could benefit from the game and inspiration .
i 'm going to end my talk .
i want to ask a question .
what 's going to happen ? "
we have so many great game play this game , that might be in the future , what we do experiments , but it did n't have anything to save the world .
i hope you agree with me , which is a gamer is a huge 资源库 we allow them to do in the real world , because this is a game of change .
we have these amazing superpowers the productivity of happiness , highly social structure of the ability to an emergency desire epic and optimism .
sincerely , i hope that we can come up with the great game here in the next one can live on this planet .
i want you to join us , to make or to support that game .
when i was waiting for the next 10 years ago , i 'm pretty sure that one of the first things we can create the future of anything that we can imagine , and secondly , we can do whatever we want to play a game .
let 's start with video games to change the world .
thank you very much .
i want to share with you a few months ago , a big that i was going to write " wired magazine article in italy
i was writing for a long time i had to put the dictionary 同义词 手边 journal editors , and realized that i had never in my life in the dictionary “ disabled ” meaning .
let me put this 词条 read to you .
“ ” adjectives , rendered as : “ disabled , 残废 helpless , useless 残破 stagnation , the destruction of the injuries , and being destroyed , and the anatomy of the surface , exhausted , the weak force of loss , low - power , paralyzed functions of the barriers of aging , and , by their tired , exhausted , does n't work , the crap , not to be considered a ” 另见 : “ injury , useless 虚弱 ” .
health , the opposite : “ capable ” , stronger .
into these voiceless . i read listening to a friend of mine , and it 's absurd . when i start 我念到 “ being destroyed ” up , i made these words , i had to stop that allow ourselves to be the ultimate indignity recovery after emotion .
synonymous with the old book , i 'm pretty shabby dictionary and i thought , well , it must be a very old 本词典 version .
but 出版日期 , in fact , it was in the 1980s , i should 刚上 schools in the context of the family and the perception of their children beside me and the connections
i mean , i was 没用过 同义词 lexicon
. i mean , through the dictionary 同义词 “ disabled ” itself to explain to you can see , in the world , and i do n't think disabled people like me , the world . we disabled , positive , but today , and i was in my life for adventure with all of the opportunities that for me .
so i immediately go online , the “ ” itself in 2009 version of disability 同义词 that i was in the dictionary expect to see some of the most important
i 'm going to show you read “ ” itself , there 's a new version of disability .
unfortunately , it ca n't explain 词条 much better than that .
in this " near the opposite of 词条 especially for me , it 's very , very uncomfortable , they 're two words : “ intact , the functional ” .
in fact , it 's not just a few words .
when people are using the negative term for the disabled , it turns out that the people with disabilities .
remarkable disabled , that is the inside of the people in the words of values , and the process of values .
our language affect our minds and our view of the world , at each other .
and in fact , the ancient greek , the power of the ancient societies that curse of words , because it gets to say that is really exist .
so , this is what we want to make things like an inability to people , or a competent people ?
sometimes we just to give a name for adults and children are potentially 限制住 development , they gave them the clouding questioned , for their own capabilities .
we do n't want to open up their minds 之门 ?
that there 's one of my life , and i opened the door of mind , and he was when i grew up for a doctor who was relatively state of my work of a . i 明顿 Dupont institute .
his name is Pizzutillo italian - american woman who was his name , obviously , a lot of the united states that 人念 p so hard , and let 's call him a doctor .
p is always a doctor and colorful , for his tie people , and he made with kids are pretty good .
besides physically training courses in his hospital in all of the time i was really happy .
很粗 , that i 'm going to use all the tape over and over again , the rich leg muscles , but i just do 体能训练 exercise 恨透 恨透了 tape , and i even gave them up .
and i was a five - year - olds , and p bargaining 求 doctors who do n't go to those 体能训练 , of course , i do n't have done
p , but one day when i was training . do they look at me , who is ruthless , exhausted , and he said to me , “ 体能训练 aimee , you know , i was a strong girl , and one day , you can put these tape broke
you broke , i was just the $ 100 “
p , obviously , this is a doctor , he was a trick . i want to do these training . i would love to do with all 二楼 “ into one day in a five - year - old patient 's room of the richest ” temptation . p. doctor , but i did one thing that 's going to work that i hate calendar , full of landscape into a new experience .
today , p , and i often think that they had a vision , and he gave me the girl ” “ strong term impact on my self - awareness that there was a big , where i 've been able to realize that my inner 强壮有力 is , i 'm a bright future .
p doctor in this case , it 's good that shows the power of adults can light the potential of a child .
more mentioned before , but in the dictionary 同义词 example of the language that we did n't allow us to do what i want to see things it does n't make a disability to realize that they are actually capable of .
and social development of the development of technology is not the language of our society 与时俱进
and of course , from my fake medicine , in terms of the surgery , to my vision of a laser artificial legs titanium king , provide elderly 股骨头 knee replacement surgery all of these technologies can make people more than enough to use their skills and to give them the constraints of environment , and for those of us , and the framework for those of us can self - worth subject allows us to choose , on a global scale .
so we said , " technology is a clear to show you the truth , which is a permanent , every one of us are very powerful societies , it 's going to be able to do is , and the ability to adapt to humanity 's greatest asset .
in our environment and skills , and i feel very interesting , because they wanted me to a lot of “ to overcome adversities ” today to talk about what i want to do a little bit about this statement “ to overcome adversities ” 这一说 for me , it does n't work , and let me just say a couple of people , i was very uneasy . why would i started thinking about .
“ to overcome adversities ” 词有 an underlying mean that it 's successful , or for happiness and all the other side of the experience of a tough but itself was not about happiness and success , like a life that i can make it because i had bypassed as a with a set of challenges 人所要 around it faster , some of my other .
really changed us , but in fact , these challenges , in our lives may change in 烙 down on this journey is the body , it might be a spiritual , it could be both .
and i want to say , the challenges facing 不失为 a good thing .
adversity , and we should treat it as we face obstacles around it will continue to our lives .
torture , in fact , it 's part of our lives .
i 'm going to torture as my own .
when there 's a lot of it , there was a very small , but it still beside me
and , of course , i 'm not trying to fight against torture and the value of people .
we adversity in my life to experience and challenge each of us , but the problem that we focus on is not whether you 're going to face adversity , but how to deal with it
and so , let our responsibility is not just about the people who live in . they were able to make it 从容应对 adversity .
and when we do n't feel like the children we actually have the ability to adapt to hurt them .
from the standpoint of medicine to determine whether i 'm an objective , from the standpoint of society , this is what i consider a “ disabled ” two and a lot of difference .
in fact , the only thing that i had to deal with this is a question of the world , i described and injustice .
we want to be able to protect the people we care about the cold , as we told them , or sometimes to predict the future of life that they do , but what we 've got to pay attention to what we 're doing , whether it would destroy the people who are
, they might be used to focus on their own , and thinking about how to fix these flaws in the norm that for the disabled than the disabled physical disabilities .
we ca n't come from a whole view of disability their ability to that is to admit that it 's very difficult situation of the problems .
effectively , we can create one of the people in the social value .
in eye , so we 're not supposed to be disabled physically , but as they should be aware of .
now , some of the most important , and in between of human creativity is there .
so hard for years , and they should be disrespected . and it 's not what we 're going to avoid or something , we should be looking in the opposite .
in fact , i 'd like to tell the truth is , not to overcome adversity 坦然 face , and we should embrace it 摔打 with it , i took a technical 摔角 摔打 dance , even with it .
perhaps , if we could torture as natural them , and that is something useful for us , and there it is not affordable .
we celebrate darwin 's 200th anniversary of the year , species of evolution as darwin over 150 years ago when he went to a truth about human nature .
the sentence and he said , " which means species will survive , more often than not , it 's not the strongest of smart , but most adaptive .
mother conflict resolution is to create .
darwin 's waiting for you and human ecologies reveals that all the power of human experience . this is after the struggle .
my ability to humanity 's greatest , again , again , is the transformation and adapt .
and maybe , before we 接受考验 , we do n't know what i was going to be .
in terms of what could that be adversities sense of self - individuals and the ability to recognize .
so , we can give themselves a gift .
we can change torture as an opportunity .
instead of hardship days .
adversity is changing before , and we just do n't have to adapt .
we tell ourselves , i think the biggest challenge is to create concepts orthodoxy . "
well , what 's “ orthodox ” ?
“ orthodox ” does n't exist .
i know what , what is a typical “ “ regular ” ” , but i do n't know what it is “ orthodox ” , if you really have that kind of poverty , the so - called “ ” orthodox people , you 're interested in them ?
and i 'm going to .
if we do n't spend energy to pursue “ orthodox ” into discovering all sorts of possibility , but in all kinds of risks , the ability to the potential for a lot of kids that are going to be better , they will be 充分运用 unique ability valuable for their communities .
anthropologists tells us that we as humans have always hope that we are in a group of people who are useful contribution are capable of doing .
society , the neanderthals around 60,000 years ago , which is a very good for the neanderthals and raise their 老弱病残 , because they believe that older people in the society of life is 阅历 for their society is very valuable .
older people are n't going to be considered as useless on the contrary , they very valuable .
a few years ago that day , i 'm going home 菜市场 northeastern pennsylvania 红区 that i was standing next 一筐 tomatoes .
because the summer , and i 'm wearing shorts
and i went back to the sound of a man who “ , yeah ? it 's not amy 慕林斯 ” ?
i turned to me , that is an old man i do n't know
and i said , " sorry , i 've met mr. “ ? i remember you ”
“ , and he says , " well , you do n't remember between us and meet .
because i was to take you from your mother , in the womb “ .
that is -- well , i met one
and of course , i want to end .
this person is 基恩 doctor , and i just by my mother gave me a story that i did n't know that that person 晚产 for two weeks , i was born in the late 产儿
charge on my mother was taking care of her to go on holiday , so the doctors from this before my parents were 基恩 doctor , who do n't know , for me .
when i was born without fibulas toes , my feet , a misplaced 基恩 doctor to convey the bad news .
he said to me , " i was diagnosed with tells you something about the parents , and i said , " well , you 'll never walk like any other kids , and you never 跑跑跳跳 independent life that you would never , ever since i was trying to take you through your became a 大骗子 ”
mr. 基恩 -- -- thank you . he did a great thing from when i started to get rid of all the paper about my childhood stories cut all gathered , including anagrams grade at the time i won the competition , and the girl scouts in the last halloween , at the university of michigan , and i think , when i got a fellowship of achievement 基恩 doctor in reading , with my story is the story of my students , he educational 哈奈曼 赫尔 and medical students in the medical
he gave me this story is called the x - in , it 's called the potential of the human mind .
without any medical diagnostics can explain how big will have the power of this will be one of the quality of life .
基恩 doctor said to me on “ , despite the fact that there are many others , in my opinion , according to my experience for the kids give them support , they can be very achievement ” .
see , the idea of 基恩 doctor changed .
and he realized that the medical diagnostics and one way to deal with this . there are differences between .
for a couple of years , i think there 's a transformation , for example , if you were to ask when i was 15 - year - old now , i would put a 真腿 毫不犹豫 i agree .
because i want to get that “ orthodox ”
but if you ask me questions about the same today , i 'm going to 三思 .
and that 's because i use the arm , and this big impact on my own experience .
may , i 've 脱胎换骨 inside , because the people i 've met someone opens the door of the world for me in my mind , more than a shadow on people .
look , you need to do is that he was able to show you one of your own .
embracing the human soul , if you give people a key , his own with the power of the keys on their own , and in this moment , and you can use it for you to open the door , which is the key in the best way to educate their
because you 're teaching them for its own on into the world .
” “ education , in fact , the meaning of the word comes “ 唤出 ” .
“ 唤出 ” policed things , which is the inside of things .
so , what we want a potential ?
there 's a case of the 1960s britain up to the middle of this process from an elementary school kids in the u.k.
in the u.k. called “ 统考 ” , in the united states , we call it the “ track ”
from the students to test scores , groups , a , b , c , d 四等 .
as a student 学更难 and , of course , there 's a better teacher .
this 为期 results in three months and the students were told that they should be [ a d is a group of students , they were told they 're very clever of three months at the end of the student has about a 等生 .
this case , of course , is that the other side of the research also has 令人心寒 , who was supposed to wait for the students were told that they 're a d students .
three months at the end of the experiment .
they have a lot of people dropping out .
this experiment , which is a key part of the teachers are also know .
teachers were 调包 students do n't know .
teachers are being told what it is also quickly 等生 , there 's a teacher 等生 d " differentiated . "
real “ ” disability , so i think it 's a beat a soul , there 's no hope for the future has been a perceive beauty of the soul of curiosity 般天 actually lost a child born into a lost the human soul of the imagination of the soul .
, if we want to be able to get the human soul 始终保持 soul and you can see that it 's the beauty of others soul curiosity and imagination , so if we give it to use their own power in a very good .
all of those qualities that is still a soul , maybe it 'll be able to create an infinite number of new life .
