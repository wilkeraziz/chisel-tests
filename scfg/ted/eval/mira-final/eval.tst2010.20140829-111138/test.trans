steve lopez one day , the l.a. times columnists hear tune beautiful music on the streets in los angeles .
music is a man a rugged , have bum african - american men with just two string a violin playing
now i 'm going to talk about this story because many of you already know steve the column of became a book , and then the movie robert Downey steve lopez jamie Foxx Jr play is what he played nathaniel anthony Ayer juilliard music training the double bass , but his career , because with paranoia , schizophrenia , and unfortunately disruption
nathaniel from juilliard school music , he was completely broken 30 years later he 流落 on skid row street in los angeles .
i encourage you to look at steve , or film is to understand not just the beautiful bonds between these two men build and music is if you help to build this ties , and that 's most useful tool and change nathaniel homeless life
and i meet mr. ayers in 2008 , two years ago in disney hall
he listened to the first beethoven , fourth symphony 后天 to introduce
he talking a very , very gregarious mentioned yo and hillary clinton dodgers could n't go into the world leagues . and it 's because the last moment in the fourth symphony start unpredictable that beethoven violin role .
we talk about for a moment of music . i got a few days later steve told me from nathaniel interested i 说学 violin
i should mention nathaniel refused to treatment is because when he is electroshock therapy with the scars 镇静剂 and handcuffed and left his life .
result , his now become easier to attack the worst of schizophrenia is he disappeared days after the attack on skid row street homeless exposed to the heart of fear , mind and the release .
nathaniel 's in a state that we did in disney hall started lesson in his eyes in the same people he 's a lost .
and he talked about the invisible devil smoke someone how to do his poison him
scared me not to worry about my own security , but i fear and he lost his immersed in his in a state of and i destroyed and he built a violin , if i started talking scale 和琶音 and other forms of wonderful 说教式 violin 教学法
so , i started 拉琴
first , i play beethoven violin concerto .
when i play , i know in a and nathaniel 's eyes .
what he grabs the invisible drugs like through the chemistry , and i play the catalyst
he also understand that the same anger quiet curious , and elegant
amazing , and he picks up his violin with and play a violin concerto some pieces and he started , i want to do 门德尔松 tchaikovsky , 西贝柳斯
so we started talking about : bach music by beethoven , 布拉姆斯 布鲁克纳 , all name starts with people from b to bartok 's been 艾沙 佩卡 porta , halonen
i know that music is not a encyclopedia , and he could connect these music with his personal .
he talked about those things with passion and understanding of music , as i communicate between colleagues in los angeles symphony .
by playing music , talking about this from a of paranoia , and just 晃悠 bum on the streets in los angeles , a fascinating 博学 great 朱丽亚 conservatory educated musician
music is music changing our medicine .
music is help on his mind , for nathaniel
because he music can help his mind delusions and form through his imagination , creativity and become reality .
and it 's this help his possibilites from .
and i know this is art 真髓
that 's why we make music we we each have a inside the heart of the most fundamental our emotions through our art lens through our creativity , to shape our emotions .
and this expression of reality we moved to all of us , enlighten us , we
and for nathaniel music to bring him back to a friend in
music force of saving bring him back to his family , where people understand that his talent respect
and i 'll never make music for the disney hall or on the streets of skid row , because he me why i 'm going to do a musician
thank you .
look at : thank you . thank you .
robert gupta .
robert gupta : now , i give you play 厚颜 窃来 from 大提琴手 melodies .
so forgive me
in my life with a lot of fish .
only two is my favorite .
the first is , passion .
it 's a beautiful fish , delicious , texture 细腻 fleshy , rich , is the most popular fish menu .
how beautiful fish .
better , and it 's the highest standards , is to keep it sustainability .
and he sold also mode .
i was 沉醉于 this beautiful relationship , and about a few months .
this one day , a company called me invited me to the activity and sustainable fisheries that .
i said , of course “ ” .
this company is trying to solve a for chefs we 're not imagine . “ on how we leave fish menu ” ?
in the last 50 years , we from fishing like logging in the ocean .
it is not exaggerating destructive .
90 percent of the big fish , the species , we love tuna , the big fish , three salmon , 剑鱼 , they are extinct .
how many almost no left .
so , whether it 's good , bad 水产 养殖业 养鱼业 , will be part of our future .
for a lot of this industry . most of them is actually about 养鱼业 pollution , and very inefficient , for example , which is the largest 弊病 tuna .
and the tuna feed 转换率 is 15 than one .
this mean for every 100 pounds tuna , 15 pounds to do with other wild fish feed .
it 's not sustainable 发展性 .
and it 's not good .
and finally , this companies to do something right .
i want to support them .
in that activity , before i contacted p.r. department the company .
so we call him “ don 阁下 ” .
i said , " “ don 阁下 , i said , you know , the fact is that in the very famous fishing , and you ca n't pollution . ”
his response : “ said to you . the place , we are dilute away fishing of pollutants , where does n't focus in a ” .
and then he to add is , we “ 独树一帜 .
feed 转换率 ? one half than ” , he said .
the best in the “ . ”
one half than , good .
“ 2.5 than one ? what you 're feed ” ?
he said , sustainability “ ” protein .
i said , " good “ ” . and the phone .
that night , i want to lying in bed : sustainable protein is what the hell ?
so the next day , before the activity , i call don 阁下 .
i said , ' don 阁下 , did you some examples of sustainability protein ? "
he said he did n't know . he would go to the people around .
and i , and in some 人通 phone company . but nobody can give me a clear . until experts , 我通 on the other is biology .
he called me and for “ don 阁下 ” .
i said , " “ don 阁下 ” “ can hypacrosaurus sustainable protein ” ?
well , he talked about some algae and 鱼食 , and he talked about 鸡丸 .
i said , " “ 鸡丸 ? ”
he said , " is “ feathers , 鸡皮 bones , dry dung , after it 添入 feed . ”
i said , " “ chicken in feed is the ratio of ” ?
think about , you know , two percent .
and he said , “ , about 30 percent , ”
i said , " “ don 阁下 用鸡 , fish , 这算 sustainable 发展性 ” ?
the phone quiet there for a long time , and he said to me , “ world is too many chicken . ”
so , i love this fish .
no , not because i was a feeling , 伪善 job .
i actually is .
no , i love this fish , no , i swear to god , because , after that conversation that 鱼尝 more like chicken .
this second fish , it is a different love .
more is that romantic , you know your fish , the more you love it .
the first time i eat the fish , where this in a restaurant in southern spain .
a journalist friends and i said , a long time ago here .
she was a explicit .
the fish in very bright , on the table with aura , the white .
chef cooking time it too .
like cooking twice .
but amazing , it 's very good .
who can make this fish food and or in the case of cooking time too ?
i ca n't , but this guy .
let 's call him 米格尔 . his name is actually 米格尔 .
but he did n't cooking , the fish , he 's not a chef . at least not in the way you understand him .
he was a biologist in 薇 拉帕尔马 tower .
he 's a 养鱼场 in spain 西南角 .
he was in high - 克维尔 river longtime 尖部 .
until the 1980s , was this fishery argentinean population .
they 're here cows was basically wetlands .
and they put water night .
and then they build a complex canal , 2 water to the river .
i mean , but they did n't succeed , economic .
and for the environment that big disaster .
around about 90 percent of the birds are gone , and in this area that is a lot of birds .
the 1982 , a company with environmental awareness of spain buy the land .
they 've done ?
they reverse the direction .
they basically moving 卡关 .
instead of 排水 aqueducts , they use this to bring water .
they fill this canal water .
and built a 27000 acres of fisheries , barracuda -- bass , shrimp , 鳗鱼 -- in this project , 米格尔 ecological , and this company , completely saved this .
this fishery too remarkable .
i mean , you 've never seen anything like that .
i looked at the horizon , it 's so vast 注满 water into your vision is the canals and abundance of swamp wetlands
so , 米格尔 and i went there .
he 's an amazing people , is a darwin , crocodiles 邓迪 .
we went into the wetlands , and i 'm 气喘吁吁 汗流浃背 淤泥 , in my knee , and 米格尔 静静 about handout .
here , and he pointed to a rare black 肩 鸢 .
this is , he can phytoplankton minerals needs .
and this , he saw a pattern 联想起 tanzania giraffe .
results , 米格尔 spent a long time working in africa meters 库米 national park .
i asked him how to become a fish experts .
he said , “ fish ? i do n't understand them .
i just a relationship . experts ”
and he started more dialogue is all about rare and birds and algae 水生植物 .
please do n't get me wrong , that 's really interesting conversation about things like biomes .
it 's good , but i love .
in was always being hyper - cooking 惦记着 that i 've 前一晚 taste delicious fish .
so i took him . i said , " “ 米格尔 fish , what you 're so good ? "
he pointed to the algae .
i know , brothers , algae “ phytoplankton , relationships are amazing .
but what you eat fish ?
feed 转换率 ? ” ?
and he told me , this is a system of abundance , on these fish that they eat in the wild .
plants , woody phytoplankton , the plankton , fish feed .
this system , it 's totally self - update very healthy .
no feed .
heard a feed farm animal feed ?
later , i was driving 米格尔 spin around , and i asked him , looks so “ a natural ” unlike any other places , a farm , i 've seen “ you measure how successful ” ?
just then , as a film director suddenly to change .
we see turned bend the most beautiful picture of a pink 火烈鸟 , pink carpet .
he said , " “ that success . ”
“ their abdomen , pink .
they 're enjoying feast . ”
feast ? i lost completely .
i said , " “ 米格尔 fish , they do n't you that the ” ?
“ is , " he said .
“ birds and we 'll eat 20 percent of the fish eggs .
and last year , this fishery 600000 只鸟 , over 250 different species .
today , has become the largest and here is one of the most important bird private 自然保护区 europe .
i said , " “ 米格尔 , the number of birds that is not a fishery do n't want to ” ?
no , he shook .
he said , “ and in general , we are not to .
this is a network .
these 火烈鸟 eat shrimp .
shrimp zooplankton .
so in their belly the bright , the system . pink ”
well , let 's look at . do n't give it a farm animal feed , and measure their success is based on its predators .
a bird fishery , is also a house .
and by the way , the 火烈鸟 , they 're not supposed to there .
they breed in town and 150 miles in the soil , there 's more for 做巢 .
every morning , they came to this fishery flight 150 miles .
150 miles to fly at night , they 're home .
but they do it because they can and A92 white of the highway .
no joke .
i 've been minds imagine endorsing penguins diary here , i looked like 米格尔 .
i said , " “ 米格尔 150 miles to fishery , they fly back 150 miles , and then at night they fly ?
they do is to kids ” ?
he looked at me like i just quote whitney houston song .
he said , " not “ better food , because they do that here . ”
i do n't mentioned i love the most of the fish , is really delicious , and i do n't usually like skin . i do n't like baking . i do n't usually like crumbly .
it 's , like 柏油 peppery .
i never do it with fish .
but the restaurant , when i was in southern spain taste it tasted like skin .
it tasted 微甜 and clean like you first a natural ocean .
i mentioned 米格尔 my idea , he nodded .
he said , the role of like sponges “ skin .
it is to prevent any material into the body and the maginot line .
it 's absorb contaminant . ” .
and he said , " water “ , but we do n't contaminated ” .
okay . a 渔厂 feed the fish . it 's not a fishery measure it 's successful , it 's the predators .
and i realized when he said , a contaminant fishery , understatement , because in fishery through the water from high kildall 克维尔 river .
now in the river in all of a chemical pollutants have river , pesticides , it .
and when it into the system and left , more than , clean water .
health system , it can filter the water here .
so this fishery , not just do n't feed animals , not just measure of the health of predators , but it 's basically a fishery or a 水净化 plants , and it 's not just for the fish , but for you and me .
because it into the water out of here , the atlantic .
i know , this is very little , but i was in it , and you should be , because this is not only , romantic love , and education .
you might say it 's the future of food diet , we say bass or beef .
now we need is a new concept agriculture , a real food .
but for a lot of people , there 's so extreme .
we 're not realist , our job . we love .
we love to market . we love little 家庭式 farms . we 're talking about regional food we eat organic food .
and when you advice these food for the future of food , somebody somewhere stood up and said , " i said , i love the pink 火烈鸟 man , but how do you make this world entrees ?
how do you attenuate for the world ? "
i can be ?
i do n't like your problem .
no , not just because we 've made this world than we need calories .
a billion people in the 饿着肚子 today .
a billion -- 那比 ever more -- the root of the distribution imbalance , not by 吨位 .
i do n't like the real question because he 拟定 a food system logic , in the last 50 years .
give single species grain to herbivores , pesticides crops , chemicals soil , chicken to fish , and all sorts of agriculture “ if we can ask simple , cheaper to more people , have n't ” . right ?
that 's a motivation . it 's been 合乎情理 . it 's a business plan of american agricultural .
we should point out , it 's a business in 清算 , a quick erosion of possible ecological capital that business .
that 's not a business , it 's not agriculture .
today are under threat , not because we 're the food supply , but because diminishing is diminishing resources .
not by the latest grafted with the invention of tractors , but on fertile soil , not by water , but not with chainsaws , fresh water , but on the forest , not by fishing boats and nets , but fish in the ocean .
want to feed the world ?
we started to ask ourselves : how do we feed ?
or better , how we can make it to create an environment every group to feed itself ?
so used to do that , do n't expect the future , now agricultural model .
it 's obsolete , and it 's fatigue .
because it 's too much on capital , chemistry and production machine , and it 's not really good food .
instead , let 's look at the patterns .
and it exists 20 billion 实战经验 .
look at 米格尔 , farmers , like 米格尔
not only their own farms , it self - back , and not consumption , general farm instead of just special relationship , not just producers , but farmers ,
because they 're also taste of experts .
and if i want to be honest , they are better than i cook .
you know , i agree with this , because if the quality of food , they will very delicious .
thank you .
if i can leave you with one idea today is that we consume information that all of the data rich than the sum of the 相加 , all the data that we consume information than the sum 相加 part of the rich , all the data that we consume information than the sum 相加 part of the rich , and instead of thinking about the information i want you to think about how to use these patterns of information , that 's invisible , we can see
so we see here is a typical age mortality graph in groups
i use tools here is a little experiment .
it , i called Pivot Pivot filter special death , like an accident .
immediately , i see a different patterns .
because in the middle here , and people in the age of active when they here is the most 体弱多病
we can back according to death and why we see disease and cancer is killing the main condition this pattern , but not for everybody
if we filter , like 40 below the age we can see it became killer people need to be careful .
to further , if you will find that a particularly for men .
well , you know about the role of tools by looking at the data , like in this way of living in vivid picture .
why do n't do if we can data on the content do ?
so every issue we show here is the cover of sports
all here , on the web .
and you can see end my talk back to your room .
Pivot , you can use to look for 10 units .
you can go to a year .
you can go into a one issue
like i see this ; i see in this 期中 athletes , sports .
i lance armstrong fan , so i click on it showed me all this is just lance armstrong part of the problems .
so again , now , if i just want to sample the data peak bicycle athletes , i thought , well , look at all ?
so , i can step back and expand this
now , i saw , greg 莱蒙 de
so you know when you go with this information narrow , open , reverse , back , you 're not in search , not to .
you actually do a little bit different .
between , and we think that 's changed the way the information .
so , i 'm on this idea that something is crazy .
we do is to pluck every wikipedia page here and compress for a little 摘要
his 摘要 contains a graph that shows it from a professional .
i just showed here before 500 wikipedia page of the most popular
but even in these limited through , we can do a lot of things .
immediately , we know what the most popular wikipedia .
and i keep government .
now , selected government after , i can see in the category of the wikipedia is time of year 风云人物
this is important because it 's not a wiki page 所载述 content .
only you back a few 透彻 overlooking the possible to see the big
look at these particular kind of economy , and then i into time magazine annual 风云人物 into them .
so , i look at these people can see from the most part of from the science . less from the business of my boss a from music .
and interestingly , bono 's ted prize winner .
so we can continue 跳转 , look at all the ted prize winner .
so you see , it 's as if we first working on the internet is a web pages , and it 's not just in higher 抽象层次 on the web .
so i want to tell you another thing you might be surprised .
i just show in new york times website .
Pivot apps , this -- i do n't want to call it the browser , it is not a browser , you can browse -- and we use it for every page introduced , like this . and we 're zooming technology for every page like this introduced zooming technology .
so i can back , back to a particular place .
why this is important because , by the way to browse the benefits of all , i can see exactly the same way i go history .
so i can go to the time events .
here , in fact , i show all .
i can playback in a way i saw earlier today .
if i want to step back and look at the history of everything , i can cut . here , maybe i search history , i did some related searches , search , about the microsoft live Labs Pivot here .
from these , i can just 重启 web them .
information , because this is the same time to be different times , and use rearrange , it 's more than the information together overall . every time , and makes it more than the whole by information together .
now , in the world , we often talk about data that curse .
we talk about information bang spells .
we talk about in information in the ocean .
and if we can put this idea of network of information , as opposed to 单线 link , let 's start to each other diversity information links diversity , and see the way , this ca n't see , hidden patterns ? and then see the way , this ca n't see , hidden patterns ?
if we can do that , not trapped in the data , we can really information .
and just process information , we can tease out .
if we get knowledge , and even see wisdom .
thank you .
i grew up in with the science fiction .
high school , i was a hours of the bus back to school every day .
long outside , i always immersed in the book , in the world of science fiction to other ideas , the narrative way , to me was strong sense of wonder .
curiosity , but i also show in other : when i do n't need to school , i always hike around in the forest , and collect specimens “ ” , frogs , snakes , yeah , yeah , 池水 insects , 通通 back home , underneath the microscope .
i was , the gourmet science mad men .
but this is to try to understand the world , probably boundaries .
and my love of science fiction is that corresponds to the world around me , because it was in the late '60s , the moon , started deep dive .
jacques . august and film photographer , bringing his amazing visual effects of our lives , that we ca n't imagine before the animal world , and a beautiful landscape .
between science fiction and all this kind of empathy .
meanwhile , i 'm an artist .
i can 绘能 .
and i found that because there was no video games , special effects 渗入 and the media industries of images , i had to create these images in my head .
and i believe that when you are , in reading , often in our brains to play writers described as 东西向 movie .
and i 'm response is the aliens , robotic spacecraft alien world , and so on .
i hide behind the textbook doodling 行径 teacher to 逮个 are being .
and so i had to for my way for other 宣泄 creativity .
interestingly , jacques . august film surprise to me to find out on this planet , there is a alien world .
maybe i could n't really in our lifetime spacecraft to marginals . it sounds so alien world .
but there is a on this planet -- i can go to the world and exotic abundance , what i was about everything .
so in the year i was 15 , i decided to become a diver .
but the only problem is , i was a little village in canada , recent sea to 600 miles away .
but i do n't have grown disenchanted .
and i and my dad , until he for selling water in new york , i found a dive 训练班 it in the other side of the 美加 borders .
so , in selling water 刺骨 深冬 , christian camp 泳池 , i got my diving certificate .
but the next two years , i too witnessed the sea , until we moved to california .
40 years after that , i spent about 3,000 hours underwater . one of the 500 hours in the submersible .
i found in deep -- even in shallow water -- a life of amazing , far beyond our imagination .
the nature of imagination than our narrow range of imagine is enormous .
until today , i saw when diving 仍令 i was amazing .
i love to , not of the ocean .
but when i need 择业 , adult , i chose filmmaker .
i was , it 's storytelling desire for to create images of the best way .
when i was a kid , i often cartooning .
and the movies images and stories together for granted , happen automatically .
of course , i 'm talking about are some science fiction story " terminator , " sex and the abyss . "
in the abyss , " i 'm going to my love of deep diving and with the filmmaker together .
to my passion , mr .
and the abyss " brought another inspire : the narrative of the video , better to create some liquid 水生物 of technology , we started using computer animation .
first in the world of computers and soft surfaces and character .
even at 电影票房 不济 , just to it , and i saw the amazing -- a global audiences all the magic , by film .
that 's arthur c. clarke -- of advanced technology and magic is to distinguish between .
and the audience saw what was this magic .
i was excited about this .
i was thinking , “ god , this technology to in the to film in art . ”
so in my next film " terminator , " we 're going to two technology pushed new stairs .
with “ industrial 光魔 ” effects film company , we created in the liquid metal guy . and the movie or success depends on this technology could work .
and it worked . we created a magic again . we got the same feedback from the audience again . but that movie to work a little bit better .
add twice , we realized that this is a new world , a new world of allowing the - art 施展 film imagination .
so i and my friend Stan Winston formed a company . Stan Winston was known of artists and 造型师 . " in the name of the company called " digital Digital Domain .
and the idea is 蛙跳 last optical printer and simulation , directly into digital .
in fact , we did this , we really the 先机 in time .
but in the mid - 1990s , we found was company is 建树 in biological design , characters , but in this one we scooped .
so i created this " avatar , to focus and graphics limits to use computer animation , create a real human emotion . the main character will by computer . the scene by computer .
but i 一鼻子灰 . people told me in our company was conditions , technology is we ca n't do the effects .
so i 'm going to put this idea to , and made a film about 大船 went down .
i was told film companies will be boat “ film romeo and juliet ” , will be a romantic epic and passion .
but 私底下 , my real goal is to visit the titanic debris .
that 's why i made that movie .
so , i say that . but company was know the movie .
i convince them . i said , we will go 船骸 “ field 取景 .
as the opening .
, very critical theater . it ”
so i convinced they invest in a risk .
it sounds crazy . but ultimately , is still about if your imagination to create a reality .
in fact , we created a reality in six months later -- i underwater in north atlantic 2.5 miles in russia , in a submersible , through a 视口 观望 real titanic .
film , not high , but immersive .
so me and lots of that experience .
early to work is terrific light , we need to build the camera , and so on .
but what really struck me is these deep dives activity as space exploration .
both are high - tech product , to serious deployment , both .
you step into the cabin , into this dark dangerous environment , if you ca n't rely on their own power back , you 're no rescue possible .
i was thinking about : “ god . i like in a 科幻电影 inside .
cool ! ”
and so deep became my new indulgence .
and of course , that down in the sense of wonder , scientific . it 's the transcendence is 探求 unknown , imagine infinite capacity , are curious ,
hollywood 's ca n't give me a experience .
and i can imagine a computer , and use effects , but i ca n't imagine it created a everything i see through diving windows .
in the process of exploration and then we look , i have to live in the hydrothermal vent , sometimes see i 've never seen before , sometimes see anyone have n't seen before , even before we had the and some things have n't been described science .
and so i 'm all shook up , to continue .
so i made a surprising decisions .
in the successful , i said , " the titanic “ well , i made in hollywood film can 告一段落 work here . in the next time , i 'm going to be a full - time explorer . ”
so , we started these expeditions .
we went to bismarckian wreck , using these robots to detect the debris .
we then went back to the titanic debris .
and created a robot that can wrap optical fibers .
purpose is deep inside the debris , to explore the like -- an adventure .
before , nobody 's seen inside of the wreckage . they do n't have the technology , so we need to create the technology .
you know , i was on the deck of the titanic , sitting in a submersible , wood looked like this , like the deck was acting band here .
i flew to explore the a little robot 船内 corridors .
although i control it , i thought , is this exploration 器内
i feel really in in the titanic debris .
that 's what i had the most incredible sense of this had met , because before the robot around detect light up , and i know the hidden behind every corner of all , the reason is the process of movies , i spent a lot of months around in this scene .
and in the studio prop made this boat , and that is a real model .
so that the experience is extraordinary .
it makes me feel a telepresence experience -- we have these robots in the form of avatar , we inject our ideology , into another form .
it 's very profound experience .
maybe we can get this idea that the world is how many decades later . i can imagine , as a science 小说迷 of the future of human society , and other cyborg to use exploration .
so through this expedition i really appreciate the wonderful , wonderful animals that live in the deep 裂口 . they 're on , is the aliens on earth .
they live in a chemosynthetic environment .
we do n't need the light .
so when you see the 500 in the ocean 地柱 degrees of the animals ,
you think they 're completely impossible .
meanwhile , i 'm also interested in space technology . this is by nature young science fiction .
and i built very closely related to the community and space , and nasa , be they consulted committee members of the real space mission , russia to visit before the astronauts 生物科学 agreement , and so we brought a series of things we 3d camera gear to the international space station .
this is memorable experience .
but what i end , convince space to follow the deep ocean , scientists
biologists , they can make personal experience . space object and scientists are people interested in extreme environment to deep 裂口 , we can actually see them , take samples 探测仪器 .
and so we 're now is the study science 太空科学 .
i put science as a child 小说迷 experience and real experience to do this industry .
in this voyage , and i learned a lot of stuff .
i learned a lot about science . but i also learned a lot about leaders to .
you think director has to be a leader talent , leadership , like 掌舵者 .
but before this exploration , i knew nothing about leaders to is .
because ultimately , i ask myself : what do i “ in ?
why do i ” ? what do i get these things ?
these damn documentaries no money .
we do n't easy . 没名 回本 没份 .
a lot of people think i 'm in the titanic between two film " and " avatar stepped back , sitting on a beach 修指甲 .
but in fact , i made these films , these films , only a few seen .
没名 , no , no money . what are you doing ?
i do this is the value of the experience for this -- and the challenge is the most challenging environment , and i do it is to discover that sense of wonder , for a small group of a team together , the impact of the wonderful cohesive .
because every time we work with 10 to 12 people . sometimes to sea on a few years for a two - three months .
and in that cohesion , and you realize that the most important thing is they of respect each other with a , you ca n't explain the task .
when you go back to the coast , you say , we need to do this “ optical fibers , this 电律 decrease , and this , that . ” , sea level of the technology , the productivity of -- these are the people you ca n't explain . it 's like the 同甘共苦 police , fighters , they know they 're able to explain to people of experience .
create a cohesion , to create a respect for cohesive .
so i made when i come back next film " avatar , i tried to apply the same principles -- respect leadership , they get your team back respect .
and that this is really changed the team .
i again with a small team came together to make the avatar in the unknown , " is n't create new technology .
exciting .
a challenge .
in four and a half the time , we become a family .
this experience changed the way i make a film .
people say about : you take the biological back to put people in the 潘朵拉 on this planet .
for me , focus more fundamental laws and the process of things , to change things .
so we got from this ?
learned what ?
i think the first is curiosity .
this is what you have the most powerful thing .
imagination is the power of a reality .
and you than this team of respect for you to all the other crown of the world .
sometimes young film director asked me : “ some of the movie . ”
the answer is : i do n't “ limitations yourself .
someone wants you to limitations , would you boundaries , but you do n't own limitations . not to take risks . ” bet lose .
the nasa has a quote : they love “ failure is not an option . ”
but in the art and adventure , must be a option , because failure to challenge all confidence .
no need innovation is important for no risk conditions .
you have to take the risk .
and this is what i want to leave you with the enlightenment , whatever you do , one of options , but fear failure is not . thank you .
i 'm going to talk about today is energy and climate , it 's a little bit surprising
i 'm going to talk about today is energy and climate , it 's a little bit surprising because my full - time job in the foundation is about the disease and agriculture 种苗 vaccine was invented spread , we need to improve the lives of the poorest two billion people in the stuff is we need to spread , to improve the lives of the poorest two billion people .
but energy and climate , in fact , these people are important , in fact , more important than the people on earth , but in fact , energy and climate , for these people . in fact , more important than the people on earth
for the climate . that means that they ca n't grow crops to years , for 洪涝 or drought climate . that means that they ca n't grow crops to years , fragile environment 洪涝 or drought these changes ways they ca n't afford these changes ways they ca n't fragile environment .
it causes riots famine , that social instability ,
to climate change , so they bring 严重后果 , and 能源价格 critical for them .
to climate change , so they bring 严重后果 , and 能源价格 critical for them .
thing , in fact , if only reduce the price of reducing poverty , you must be one thing 能源价格 , in fact , if only reduce the price of reducing poverty , you must be one 能源价格
能源价格 as human history , down , advanced civilization is based on advanced energy .
能源价格 as human history , down , advanced civilization is based on advanced energy .
the coal before the industrial revolution in the early 20th century , we have a choice rapidly falling , that 's why we can enjoy refrigerators air conditioning early in the early 20th century , we have a choice rapidly falling , that 's why we can enjoy air conditioning fridge , and we can have all kinds of modern things can do all sorts of things
that power , in a wealthy world , we can live with this beautiful
, but when we reduce choice , and make it cheaper twice as much as we have a new constraints , this is about , we have a new limit co 2 , and this limit co 2 .
co 2 is global warming , and co 2 emissions equation co 2 is very easy to global warming , and actually co 2 emissions equation is very straightforward
huge co 2 emissions will lead to the temperature up to the huge co 2 emissions caused the temperature up the temperature of very serious consequences for the weather , directly or indirectly , ecosystem for ecosystem ca n't deal with a radical change is full of the ecosystem collapses for the weather , directly or indirectly , ecosystem for ecosystem ca n't deal with the result of radical change is full of the ecosystem collapses for the weather , directly or indirectly , ecosystem for ecosystem ca n't deal with , the result is full of ecosystem collapses .
more co 2 emissions and temperature rise of what the relationship between how positive effect co 2 emissions . why ? what temperature rise up and the relationship between how positive effect co 2 emissions . why ? what temperature rise and into the relationship between how positive effect ? why that 's not sure , but not in the middle .
and exactly how serious side of global warming , it ca n't exactly sure , but be very serious and exactly how serious side of global warming , it ca n't exactly sure , but certainly is .
i have so many times to top scientists : we have to really co 2 emissions down to zero ? i have so many times to top scientists : we have to really co 2 emissions down to zero ?
down to half a quarter or no ?
the answer is , unless we temperature going up to zero , otherwise , it 's a huge challenge the answer is , unless we temperature going up to zero , otherwise , that would be a huge challenge .
the answer is , unless we temperature going up to zero , otherwise , that would be a huge challenge .
and that 's from a 12 - foot by truck 限高 10 - foot bridge , just to 挤过去 . this is from a 12 - foot by truck 限高 bridge , just to 挤过去 10 feet .
of co 2 emissions is completely it down to zero .
the amount of co 2 emissions , every year we is more than 260 gigatons we every year , the amount of co 2 emissions than 260 gigatons
poor countries , about 20 tons per capita american 人约 emissions than the global emissions per ton , about five tons poor countries , about 20 tons per capita 人约 emissions than global emissions per ton , about five tons .
the poor countries , about 20 tons per capita 人约 emissions than global emissions per ton , about five tons .
anyway , we all have to change , until this down to zero anyway , we all have to change , until this down to zero .
this number on up , yet only 经济波动 suppress it up a little bit of .
and the digital now go up , we only 经济波动 suppress it up a little bit of momentum it not only to turn up the momentum , to make it down , and we all the way down to zero it not only to turn up the momentum , to make it down , and all the way down to zero .
this formula co 2 four , 四者 multiply this formula co 2 four , 四者 multiply equation 左面 co 2 emissions , our goal is to make it down to zero co 2 = population x amount of per capita services x amount of average 耗用 for every unit of energy co 2 x every unit of energy co 2 = population x amount of per capita services x amount of average 耗用 for every unit of energy co 2 x every unit of energy co 2 = population x amount of per capita services x amount of average 耗用 for every unit of energy co 2 x every unit of energy and let 's look at the individual factors , and look at how the equation zero , and let 's look at the individual factors , and look at how the equation zero
obviously , we need to at least one factors very high 近于零 , it 's simple algebra
obviously , we need to at least one very factors 近于零 algebra ♫ high school , it 's simple , we look at first population
first , we look at people
now 6.8 billion people in the world , it will continue to about 90 billion
now 6.8 billion people in the world , it will continue to about 90 billion
if we develop new vaccine , health care , health of work to do . if we develop new vaccine , health care , health of work to do this number probably can meaningfully 10 to 15 percent reduction , that number of growth about 1.3 , that can be 10 to 15 percent reduction of growth about 1.3
second factors that we use .
this : the food we ate all things , wearing clothes , television , heating , is something very wonderful things , including all : we eat , wearing clothes , television , heating , are very wonderful things
that everything : we eat food , wearing clothes , television , heating , are very wonderful things out of poverty means everybody on the planet to these factors 进一步提高 services , this is good poverty means everybody on earth to provide these services , that factors 进一步提高 is good .
poverty means to provide these services , everyone on the planet that factors 进一步提高 is good .
in the rich developed world , a billion people , maybe you can control consumption , some services in the rich developed world , a billion people , maybe you can control consumption , less enjoy , but in general , this will be some services per year up , services , as more than enjoy , but in general , this will be year , per capita services , as more than enjoy , but in general , this will be year per capita , ultimately , enjoy services , as more than
in this area , and we have very basic services : you home written homework lighting lights ? in a very basic services , we deserve : you have written homework at home light ?
these kids , no , so they go out to write without these kids to sit down the street lamp , so they go out to write down the street lamp , sitting
the next is efficiency , which is the energy consumption for each on this , we have some good news : factors that wo n't 持续上升
on this , we have some good news : this factors going up
through various invented a new way of light , and through new technologies , new way of building , and invent a new way of light , new technologies , we can take a lot of new way of building for the energy consumption can even lower 90 percent reduction , individual , we can take a lot of services consume 90 percent reduction , individual services , can even lower energy
we can take the energy consumption of services , can even 90 percent reduction , individual services
航空运输 , but other services , like fertilizer production , can improve more limited space , but other services , like fertilizer production 航空运输 can improve more limited space , but other services , like fertilizer , 航空运输 , can lift more limited space .
so , look , this optimism to estimate , maybe we can get three to six down so estimate , integrated , this optimism , maybe we can do for three to six .
, about three factors , we will the emissions from 260 tons to 130 gigatons , that 's not enough , we have about three factors , the emissions from 260 tons to 130 gigatons , it 's not enough , about three factors , we will the emissions from enough to 130 gigatons , that 's 260 tons
and finally , we look at the fourth factor , which is a key and finally , we look at the fourth factor , which is a key every unit of energy is the co 2 emissions
our problem is , that can really to zero ?
certainly not 烧气 , coal .
certainly not 烧气 , coal .
all power all the way we produce carbon dioxide , except for the developing renewable with nuclear power all the way we 'll produce carbon dioxide , except for developing with nuclear renewables .
so , we need to build a global system , we need new energy , so we need to build a global system , we need new energy .
so , we need to build a global system , we need new energy .
although i word “ miracle ” , but it 's not that it is impossible .
microprocessors miracle , pc is a miracle , and the internet is .
microprocessors miracle , pc is a miracle , and the internet is .
so , you 've even seen in a lot of miracle happening
generally , we wo n't miracle happening last deadline generally , we wo n't miracle happening last deadline
usually , you just passive , some miracle happening , some have
but in this low - carbon emissions that , we have to fight , and eventually deadline ago to this miracle , but in this low - carbon emissions that we all have to push , and eventually deadline ago to this .
i think , how do i present this better ? is there a vivid expression of nature ?
i think , how do i present this better ? did have a vivid expression of nature ? imagination that can show some people ?
i back to a year ago i brought some mosquito here , you like it like me back to a year ago i brought some mosquito here , you like it .
mosquito that 与会者 to really realize : some of the world is mosquito life with mosquito that 与会者 to really realize that some people living with mosquito : the world .
so , if you talk about energy today , i think this : fireflies
this year , i decided i send fireflies are here for the environment , i decided to release fireflies is this year i here for the environment .
this is a natural fireflies , it was n't bite people , maybe they 懒得 that jar
this is a natural fireflies , it was n't bite people , maybe they 懒得 that jar
this is a natural fireflies , it was n't bite people , maybe they 懒得 that jar energy problem like fireflies , but actually have to have a lot of very limited like fireflies . to have a lot of energy problem , but actually very limited .
we need is a solution , or a lot of solutions , very 规模性 and reliability . we need is a solution , or a lot of solutions , very 规模性 and reliability . we need is a solution , or a lot of very 规模性 and solutions , even though you people 多方 exploration , i think we can only five direction as big as people 多方 exploration , i think we can only five direction as big
i did n't tides , geothermal , fusion and biofuels , something that would contribute
i did n't tides , geothermal , fusion and biofuels , all the difference if they can do better than i expected , of course , but the key is , we have on five ways of all , but the key is , we invest in five to all of the way into because they ca n't seem hard and contains tough challenges all up , because they ca n't because they seem hard and up , because they are tough challenges
look at first , coal burning fossil fuels 烧气 first look at coal burning fossil fuels , or 烧气
we need to do , simple , it 's not to do is to take all the burning of co 2 , chimney store to collect and pressure , things , we do is to take all the burning co 2 , chimney , and then spill store , and pressure , things that do n't need to do is to take all the burning of co 2 , chimney , and store , and pressure , things that do n't spill
can do to 60 percent of the trials have 80 percent level , but to do 100 percent of the very difficult to 80 percent of the trial can have 60 percent level , but to do 100 percent very difficult and store , where a lot of co 2 to the most difficult is this is a long - term controversial .
who can make it ?
these waste , a billion times and other waste waste , who can make safe ? these long - term waste , a billion times and other waste waste , who can make safe long ?
this big amount of co 2 , so difficult
this big amount of co 2 , so difficult
next , nuclear , the three big problem .
next , nuclear , the three big problem . it costs , especially in highly 管控 countries , very high - security problem , that turned even had an operation fuel not even be used as weapons .
and how to deal with nuclear waste .
even though it is n't , but a lot of concerns .
the solution to make people feel good 安心
so maybe it 's difficult , but three can solve the problem to keep
i put together in the last three , five energy
it 's three people normally called renewable energy
in fact , they do n't need to fuel , but also have shortcomings
the first is the energy density , collect these technologies to far less than plants first is that these technologies to collect the energy density , much less .
this energy scale agriculture , which is a square kilometer big 几千倍 than the plant .
and energy is that these .
the sun 's not all day , every day , is not the same
if all these other channels where you have to have spent 间歇期 energy , and you spend energy , in other channels 间歇期
so , we have a huge problem and the cost of challenge , for example , a source of energy you do n't need energy , not only to deal with energy in the country .
and then finally , the store .
to this question , and i look at all the battery to this question , and i look at all , the battery , the computer , cell phones , a flashlight , put it all the stuff on the battery 电量 everyday world consumes electricity storage , i found that we can make all the battery all the energy stored 10 minutes
so , in fact , we need a big breakthrough technology than a good 100 solutions need a better than technology now 100 solution .
it 's not impossible , but not easy
so , we can use that energy for 20 , 30 percent of the energy
but if you want to 100 percent on it , you need a battery very efficient .
so , how do we do on the right way where ?
this is a manhattan project ? how do we get side ?
we need a lot to work , 几百家 company
for each of the five ways , we all need at least a team of 100
in a lot of people , you think they crazy , that 's right .
team at ted , i think , in a lot of people started to have .
bill have 好几家 company , one called eSolar solar fever , have great technology called bill have 好几家 company , one eSolar solar fever , have great technology
vinod , the 科斯 invested in their work great 几十家 companies , and the interesting possibilities i plan to support their projects .
actually 纳珊米赫 wald and i 've been in a company , maybe a little bit surprising , but this company is nuclear energy .
in terms of nuclear , recently some little innovation , like liquid mold , etc.
but innovation in this industry has stop for a while there so some good ideas not too strange .
the idea is : do n't burn uranium Terrapower U235 Terrapower the idea is : do n't burn uranium U235 burn 99 percent , but U238
this is a crazy idea , but actually , people have about a long time
there 's a crazy idea , but actually , people have about a long time , but not very good 模拟出 whether this works of modern supercomputer and upgrade simulation , and we can now do see , just for materials , this is possible .
and because we burn before discarded , 99 percent of the waste can cost to dramatically reduce
you actually make waste fuel never do n't worry about how to deal with all the reactor waste , this is a good news .
never do n't worry about how to deal with all the reactor waste , this is a good news .
this technology , like a candle , 烧尽 uranium waste
like this process this column , often called wave reactor
the problem solved .
this is a waste in kentucky .
this is the 99 percent waste , that 's out of fuel called up the U235 uranium
these power hundred years for the
another program , just by low - cost filtering water get fuel supply for the rest of the earth to use
you see there in front of a challenge , but it 's an example of hundreds way we need to keep pushing
we think , how do we measure .
how should we report on a ?
let 's look at our goal , and we look backwards . let 's look at the mid - mid - our goal , and we look backwards .
have a lot of people in 2050 years ago about 80 percent 减碳
it 's really important , we have to do this .
and the share that 20 percent of the poorest countries like some agricultural countries , and we 've cleaned up the timber industry and hopefully in concrete
so that 80 percent developed , and china , these countries together to change the way they .
if we deploy the zero technology is another level , we are all in the developed world using 该项 technology and in the process of to other parts to
very important .
it 's got the best 答卷 key
back from by 2050 , how should we 2020 grades ?
well , two parts
we should look at the censorship efficiency measure co 2 emissions less , we start reduce emissions less the temperature and the low
but some perspective , we 've done by 2020 emissions , but not to do something much lower emissions thing is , or just weigh the importance of the other thing that 's the key innovation that breakthrough
we need to full breakthrough we can use these technologies to companies in the number of experiments , project , or of policy changes measure
about this a lot of good .
al gore " our choice , " david , for example , sustainable energy 麦基 " no hot . "
and research , and they built a broad framework for it to questions about 广泛支持 because we need to have this .
need 多方 of collaborative
this is a wish .
we invented this technology is a very specific very real wish .
if i wish for the next 50 年许 a president who choose to when or a vaccine , or i love career choice was invented this energy that 能源价格 cut in half and zero energy technology that i would choose
this is one of the
if we ca n't think this wish short - term goal and people will have a huge disagreement between the long - term goal and china , between rich and poor , will have a huge divergence and the poorest two billion people in most of life would be great .
so what we have to do ?
what i implore you to move ?
we should funded research .
on like copenhagen conference of co 2 emissions should not just talking about .
should be talking about the low into innovation . these innovation makes you was absolutely
, we really need to market , carbon dioxide 税费 year to signal price and deal with these things .
we need to put information lets
we should make this dialogue more rational , including to understand what the government .
this is a big wish , and i think this is a wish .
thank you .
thank you .
moderator : thank you .
thank you . thank you , i understand more Terrapower first , you can say about this investment is more mass ?
bill gates : if you just a supercomputer , software to hire these brilliant scientists , we 've done with about we even to a couple of russia reactor test our materials and see if it can work together and spend a few billion .
the experiment is built reactor 筹措 billions , find where manager , selected to build this first that nuclear
when you built the first , if it 's really like to say , and everything that simple , because it economically , nuclear energy density and we 're completely different .
interviewer : so , to say , this is to build a underground built this abandoned uranium fuel 柱 a vertical built this abandoned uranium - fuel 柱 and 渐进 from the top ?
gates : yeah . the reactor , and you have to re - plus fuel so many causes and control might go wrong , you need to open reactors to fuel moved out , do n't all be wrong , you need to put the reactor , insurance fuel moved out , maybe a little bit wrong , no insurance
so , if there are very cheap fuel , the size of a 木柱 enough , 60 years , so , if there are very cheap fuel use the size of a 木柱 enough , put it down 60 years , not that complicated .
put 烧个 60 years , and not there .
moderator : that the nuclear waste is itself with standing
this process of garbage gates : yeah . you can put it there , to just a few waste that you can put it in another nuclear burning and you can put it in another nuclear burn
we can start with the existing nuclear waste that now at the cooling ponds or reactor 罐里 of waste is when we started fuel .
, this is the reactor in trouble , but we material itself , also reduce waste , this is the reactor in trouble , but we material itself , also reduce waste , this is the reactor in trouble , but we material itself , also reduce waste , the reactor , the trouble , but we material waste , and also decrease .
interviewer : you and other places , when people talk about these .
what most people interested in doing this ?
gates : we do n't have chosen a particular place because there are all about nuclear secret rules that many people in india , russia , china are interested in the company , i 've here talking about how to minister into this energy .
总地 , i 'm optimistic , and french and japan have done some work
there is a variations .
this is an important , but a fast reactor many countries have built this reactor you already have fast reactor , could be the first constructionists using nuclear waste a stand
moderator : it to you , this project of time and how likely ? thank you , this project of time and possibilities ?
gates : a scale that power , and very low cost to gates : a very low cost to this mass of power , and we have to be invented , 20 years to 20 years .
this idea is that we calculate the ultimate deadline model of this idea is that we calculate the model of the deadline
if Terrapower best , of course , that would n't easy , can easily enough that if Terrapower best , that would n't easy , of course , you can easily to this .
now 数十家 companies and in doing this . we need to 几百家 if they science progress . if they experiment power . they can compete funding this task
if that 多方 that 's because it can also use of the best way
but we need a at least to success .
moderator : if the mass of innovation that if you know , one of the biggest
breakthrough gates : energy is the most important thing .
without limitations of the environment , it would be the most important question to make it more out of the environment , more urgent .
in the field of nuclear , and other innovators
but for their work , i know some people we do n't like about this project in tiles , is another way of innovation
there 's a liquid reactor , up to a little difficult , but maybe they see the way we think .
so many different ways , but the beauty of nuclear , uranium molecules in your energy is a million times the other energy , like , coal , but the beauty of nuclear energy contain uranium molecules is a million times , like the coal , other energy radiation if can process negative , mostly if can process negative , mostly radiation 其碳 emissions , cost , and the potential for the potential , it would be an 其碳 emissions , cost , and the potential for the potential , it would be an 其碳 emissions , and the potential for the potential , it cost , will be .
so , if we could n't do ?
what we have to take 紧急措施 to make sure that the temperature stability ?
gates : if things to step like eating too much , that might get heart and heart disease ? you might need .
a study called geo - engineering through technology to slow down for us to global warming 20 or 30 years of
but , like a insurance policy .
you do n't want you to use
some people say no to study because it to make people 懈怠 insurance heart you eat , but you know you can save
think about the importance , i do n't know if this is now talking about engineering earth should as a backup to choose , situation worse faster or technological innovation later we expect the
moderator : the theory of climate change skeptics , if you said 一两句话 how would you convince them ?
bill gates , unfortunately , the skeptics from different camp
they rarely the science of evidence .
they say that the result is because of the cloud 负反馈 they say that 负反馈 because the cloud .
they can give very compelling evidence even million probability
the main question like hiv
now wrong of suffering , the future .
so , when you of urgent problem now suffering profitable relationship to the future and a pain of uncertainty , actually , it 's not the worst ipcc report , rich people see report , and said , okay , and after a report , rich people , it 's okay .
in fact , not sure that we should move to the effort
but i wish is , if you make energy production economy , and also to limit co 2 emissions , but i wish is , if you make energy production economy , and also to limit co 2 emissions skeptics say : okay , so i do n't care co 2 emissions so skeptics say , well , i do n't care co 2 emissions . i hope it even a co 2 emissions , but i 'll follow this new way , because more energy than ever before cheap .
but i 'll follow this new way , because more energy than ever before cheap moderator : if you can say , this is contrast 约恩隆 伯格 response that , if you spend all to solve the problem of co 2 , which will replace the goal is that , if you spend all other energy to solve the problem of co 2 , which will replace goal to solve the world , poverty , or other malaria and money to cast in the capital of waste , we have more important things to make money cast in the capital of waste , we have more important things to do
the gates : actually developed into many americans , should n't actually more 100 亿在 into this year , it should n't impact on the other things gates : actually developed into many americans , should n't actually more 100 亿在 into this year , it should n't impact on the other things gates : actually developed into many americans , should n't actually more 100 亿在 into this year , it should n't impact on other things .

for return to 投巨资 career , if not economic basically waste , for me , disagree that some people might need 投巨资 career , if not economy , for me is basically waste , disagree that some people might need 投巨资 career , if not economy , for me is basically waste , disagree that some people might
unless you 've close , and you invest in curve , and it will become cheap unless you 've close , and you invest in curve , and it will become cheap otherwise , i think we should try 多方 cost potential otherwise , which i think we should try 多方 have low - cost potential .
if energy to address climate , to be uncompetitive very expensive , only to use the if to solve the climate , to be uncompetitive very expensive , only the energy to use .
for in you , if not 能源价格 five times , our way of life for in you , if 能源价格 five times , not affect our lives .
but for that two billion people on earth is a disaster .
and 伯格 mists of his argument , that has changed now is , why do n't get more .

bill gates : thank you .
a few years ago , on the ted conference , peter Skillman introduced a design challenge called “ marshmallow ”
is a very simple idea to a group of four independent of the team building a building material is a tape 20 roots in italy , a rope a marshmallow
to put on the marshmallow
this simple , because it 's not easy to ask people to quickly .
i think this is an interesting idea . i put it 专题讨论 design meeting
very successful .
since then , i make in the global 专题讨论 activity over 70 design students architects and designers , even fortune 50 cto practice in many ways that gave us the profound inspire us . i 'm here to share with you some
normally , people always start talking about this task .
they talk about what is a result , sort of like they debate wrong .
and then spent some time , they just draw drawings and italy linguine
they use a lot of time in italy noodle - more and more .
and the last time , to use them carefully put marshmallow marshmallow out the top , and then they step back , ha ha . they enjoy their .
but most , what happens is “ haha ” became “ bad ” because the weight of the whole structure to 散架 marshmallow .
so some people had their “ bad moment ” worst is more than one new of business school graduate students
they 're lying , they cheat , it 's very easy to find the really crappy
of course , they created some team more “ haha ” moment of the best , is the new school kindergarten 小朋友
this really incredible .
not only as PETER told us they created and they build the structure of the building is the most interesting .
so you ask what 's going on ? they have qualities ?
peter like said “ because no kids to italy ceos of linguine ” is .
they did n't over power on any time
but one another .
because the training is to find a business school students educated right .
and then they follow .
but the fact is , when they put marshmallow when they finished limited time at the top , and then ?
the crisis arrived .
listen familiar ? yes .
kindergarten kids do not as they start marshmallow 先建 prototype a model , and in 上加建 in always to keep on the marshmallow , so they have a chance to prototype to model .
so designers to recognize that interact with is this important process
for every version , kids will quickly feedback they know what , ok .
so is the key to prototype . let 's see how different team .
most of the average height is 20 feet 人建 good business school students , about half a lawyer , but to kindergarten kids , where it 's less than most adults .
who do best ?
architects and engineers , thank god .
i met the tallest tower is 39 inches
why ? because they understand triangles and self - key stable , geometric patterns are building structure
president , but some interesting than the average a is
if you add a team in their 行政助理 many they immediately became well .
it 's incredible , you look around , you say that “ committee win . ”
you already know , why ?
because they have special simplified .
they management process , they know .
anyway , any positive management and focus on a group of the work itself , groups have significant improvement
that particular skills and good use of success of a combination of two .
if you have 10 个队 to this activity of about six 个队 can build upright structure .
i did try an interesting
i thought , let 's to bet .
so i offered 10 million dollars worth of software to 得胜 group .
you guess what the students have to design the response ?
and how ?
this is not a group out a standing buildings
any one group , an inch of a building that they can plexiglas trophy 捧 back
so interesting , is a prize a big impact .
and then we in the same students repeat this activity .
you guess what ?
now they know 做样 model of value .
so the group that became the best group
they use building the minimum amount of time .
these , we all have a very deep educational reveals reward and the essence of success .
so , you might ask : what time somebody wrote a marshmallow challenge
because i can use 电子工具 process to help people make cars , and video games and simulation 视觉效果
and the challenge of the marshmallow suppose some of us recognize hidden
because , frankly , have their own marshmallow every project .
this challenge provides can share the experience of a common language processing universal .
is this simple practice can provide valuable experience .
if you have to marshmallowchallenge website .
this is a blog tell you how you can read the marshmallow building .
there concrete steps .
and weird example of how people from around the system .
there 's a world record
and i believe , is the most fundamental 教意 design is actually a movement .
it requires we put us all 神志 task we use to state of mind we perceive our best to meet the challenges we face .
and experience , a little 样板 models would help us “ bad moment ” became “ ” haha ” moment .
the result is that the different
thank you .
let 's suppose there 's a machine .
it 's a very , very cool , ted machine , it 's a time machine .
everybody here to go into this time machine .
you can go back to the past or into the future , is n't stop at the moment .
i think , how would you choose recently , i asked my friend times the answer this question , they are “ back ” .
i do n't understand . they said , no cars , twitter or back to the " american idol .
i do n't really understand .
i 'm sure , there is some nostalgic fondness or wishful thinking .
and i can understand this .
but i have to admit , i 'm not so with them .
i do n't want to go back , not because i like risk ,
but because on this planet , you can go past , not to go into the future .
so , i want to go into this machine , into the future .
our time is the most beautiful , whether you , which way to measure , health , wealth , mobility , opportunities and down .
never good time .
i had died at 60 - year - old grandparents .
in my grandparents 70 die .
my parents died is 80 age .
i hope i die in a digital with nine .
but it 's not just about these people , because we reality than ourselves .
a child born today in new delhi like 100 years ago as long as the most of the world .
you think . this is an amazing fact .
why in the fact that ?
because we smallpox eradicated smallpox had a millions of life on earth .
it with layout of the earth 's population , ca n't than any war .
but it has been completely eradicated today .
it is human abolish .
just before generation in today 's rich society to millions of people that life has almost no threat of disease .
白喉 polio measles , germany , almost all does n't exist .
you know , these names mean ?
vaccine and modern medicine and the human food for millions of people , these are the scientific method to win .
in my view , the scientific method is constantly trying to test , the process of change . it is one of the greatest 功绩 human .
so these are the good news .
but unfortunately , that 's good news , because we met some other problem was mentioned , many times .
one is , we had tremendous progress in the world , but now billion 吃不饱 belly , every day , and they 're all suffering with hunger .
this number , and still rising up speed . this is to let embarrassing .
but the human imagination huge waste back to earth .
water , arable land , rainforest , oil , gas , these disappeared , and all the resources to disappear and fast , unless we understand innovation , we have no hope .
the question is : we do ? i think we can do it .
i think we can produce enough food for billions of people , and not damage they depend on land .
i think we can find environmentally energy to feed the world .
i really believe that this theory , this is not 臆想 .
but i always have to sleep at night . this is one of the things to sleep at night . i never like today in human history need technological progress .
and we never history time like today , we can follow the will to use these technologies .
in many areas , we stand in an era of that . in fact , i think we need to look at 300 years ago , back to back before the renaissance , the only people in the that , to fight , to be more people than we today violent resistance to the progress of technology .
people always like to put their own ideas framework , they own 包得 dead , often ca n't 脱身 .
even hear truth ca n't make them into .
listen , everybody can he insisted , they can even to view of progress ,
but you know what you ca n't keep ?
you ca n't just , you know the truth . really , you ca n't .
i spent time is insight .
about 10 years ago , i wrote a story to the new yorker about a little story .
but i found that there 's so 多人要 against their against the most effective health preventative in human history .
i really do n't know how to do , i just do to do . written story , i do something else .
shortly after , i wrote an article about genetically engineered food .
and it 's got a lot of against 声浪 , over time .
this is crazy people .
so i wrote an article on , i ca n't really understand why people understand that as “ devil ” food , i do n't understand why people will think , a certain way than to carry the molecule is in any way , with nature .
but i just do i wrote to do . i finished , whether it .
i 'm a journalist .
our job is articles , published , eat , this is our lives .
but these australians made me feel uncomfortable , because i do n't know what , until i know .
who used to actually not fanatical aficionado of drives me crazy molecules
they are ideas , educated , integrity citizens .
they 're like people in this room .
this , let me really .
later , i want to be honest .
we have today for the progress of different down .
we are now in a very confused eye view .
we 're going to talk about the irony in progress , and with quotes : “ ” progress .
i think there is reason , what we know why .
our institutions , government , sometimes even trust , science has lost , maybe the reason we really do n't trust .
about a name , you know what it is a reason .
博帕尔 , chernobyl , whom the challenger , anti - arthritis , weapons of mass destruction , the vote and a half .
i think you can put in a 列出来 list .
we used to completely trust is always right now , all wrong . so you have to have a little bit skeptical .
ask a question for that , and the evidence .
ca n't do everything else .
but one thing to notice , when you get evidence , you need to accept that evidence , but we do not good .
reason , i think , is we now have the disease , an epidemic of fear and the more depth is never experience , i hope , not show .
12 years ago , a news media 暴光 , it 's a very scary news , it will get measles , 腮腺炎 and autism 风疹 vaccination together .
really scary .
so there 's a lot of research and around that event .
really have to do research , because that is a serious .
the data .
data from the united states , britain sweden , canada , and the same conclusion autism and the vaccine , no , no , no connection .
but this does n't mean too big for the story . because we like to believe that , we believe that we see the eyes , we believe that we see inside the we think the real thing .
but do n't believe that a bunch of assayed document , do n't believe from government data , and i can understand this , i think we all have this psychological .
but the consequence ?
, an unthinkable .
please hear this fact : the united states is the only vaccinate measles down .
that 's enough to make us feel shame , we should be ashamed .
it 's terrible things .
what is to make this happen ?
now i know . really .
so people get measles here ?
because some of you see people get measles and death ?
no , no more .
in fact , it wo n't happen in this country , but also in the last year , because with measles 16 million people died .
this is a huge , basic is and have 20 people die every hour .
but because it 's not happening all around us , we can whether this things , like jenny is still the that people can spread on oprah and larry king show their fear and ignorance .
they do because they have no reason to link together .
they do n't know , that looks like never actually not .
we need to learn lessons from , and the good 越早 .
this is jonas salk Salk man is a hero .
because he invented the polio vaccine to avoid the worst disaster .
now people do n't need to be this disease , cancer , do n't have the pain of the polio disappeared .
not so 风光 the men in the middle .
his name is paul offit .
he with some other researchers invented 轮状病毒 vaccine .
this vaccine can save the developing world every year four billion 50 million children .
that is good , right ?
good . this is really paul will tell people around this vaccine , how good they 并称 , and people can say goodbye 苦楚 .
he said that indeed .
so , we paul as terrorists .
when paul testified to open , he must have arms around security .
he would get to call because people at home , he said they know where kids in school .
why ? because paul invented a vaccine .
i do n't need to talk about this , but the vaccine is really important .
once vaccination , disease and back , and very scary diseases , is this happening .
now also measles united states .
and it gets worse , soon , you have children die from this , because it 's a digital .
it 's not just measles .
and polio , who do n't say it again ?
one of my college students a few weeks ago i wrote a letter to me and she said , a little too 张扬 now .
never before that .
she said she did n't intend to inoculate kids polio vaccine . do n't .
okay .
why ? because this country polio . but you know ?
we have this epidemic yesterday .
today , i do n't know , maybe a guest from lagos on the plane , his destination is l.a. airport , now to ohio .
a few hours later , he came to the ground , he 打车 to long beach , here at ted of a dinner party .
he did n't know are infected polio , we do n't know , this is the fact of the world .
that is like this . do n't think of our planet not .
we like to believe that lies . we all love .
everybody in the morning you eat vitamins chips ?
紫锥花 , or a antioxidants , only fed that you feel awake .
you do that , because every day and a half of americans do that .
they eat it , and will replace drugs , even though we already know these things are actually ineffective .
data is said that .
these urine . and that makes you lot eating , they ca n't afford anything .
if you want to spend 280 dollars to get some black , urine .
i 'm not against .
the black , urine black .
why do that ? why ?
i think maybe we can understand . very large pharmaceutical industry in this country .
and we hate governments , because we do n't trust people there .
but we do n't have to do our healthcare system .
for millions of citizens , that 's a system .
and for people to pay . and this is absolutely grim ruthless of health care system .
so we want to escape . stay where this system ?
we invested huge and placebo .
oh , i love this wonderful placebo .
but you know , so it 's a serious things because this is a lies , but we 却花 billions of payoff to buy a placebo .
i brought all kinds of samples .
none of them is effective , whether it 's 银杏果 , 紫锥花 阿薩伊果 , 幌子 . i do n't even know what it is , but we have spent billions of payoff to buy them , this is wrong .
but you know ? when i say to people here , i scream . they say , what you “ tube 闲事 ! people to do it !
eat placebo at least make people feel comfort inside ! "
you know ? you 're wrong .
i 'm not within . if the united states , the minister of health and public 事业部 “ experts that no matter what i find evidence of mammograms now ? " or a cancer quacks treated by coffee enema to his patients .
if you believe that belief and magic and non - science and evidence , and you just to a place where you do n't want to .
maybe you eventually become leaders thabo before .
he insisted that beetroot 根蒜 柠檬油 than we can slow down and hiv antiretroviral drugs that led to more effective treatment for aids 40 million people die because infected with hiv .
thousands of people die of ben to death . that 's where the most severe global hiv infected .
please tell me 严重后果 of these cases is n't .
that is there , there 's always .
now , we have the ignorance is an organic 精耕 genetically engineered crops and crops stupid between two camps .
this is also a stupid argue . we have to stop this argument .
because just argue " and the metaphor .
argue about ideology , is not about science argument .
we 吃进 belly in every thing , a , every single parsley , each one 布鲁塞尔 豆芽 have been human change .
because in paradise was no orange ,
no 哈密瓜 .
more are artificial . do n't have a christmas tree .
the last 一万一千 created these things .
some success , some experiments failed .
the failed attempts at being discarded .
and now we can do more precise way . it would have risk , but we can put vitamin a rice genes , it 's going to save millions of people , or their life extension of life .
you try to do that ?
i said , " i do n't understand it .
we are against a genetically engineered food .
why ?
the reason i hear is : genetically engineered food chemistry , too much , much pesticides , hormone 单一化 production , we do n't want the 数百亩 are really , that same crop production .
we do n't want to companies for new patent on crops .
we also want to corporations monopoly seeds .
you can guess i respond to these objections ?
guess right , let 's , to solve these problems .
well , we had a very big food problem , but it 's not science .
because it 's not science .
this law , ethical patent law , the problem .
you know , science is not a company ,
not a country .
not even an idea , it 's a process .
this process , but sometimes , successful failure because fear and we think we should scientists to do a very scary jobs , that would be millions of people to the prosperity .
the next 50 years , we need to grow more than 70 percent of the food .
this is the total we invest in africa last 30 years .
and we really embarrassing .
these people need there , but we do n't yet .
why ? because genetically engineered food .
we encourage people to eat the food wrong , like the wrong cassava .
the world have 5,000 people living on eat cassava .
that 's a crops to potatoes like .
and only calories , taste .
no , no protein , there are scientists in to try to put these cassava .
and to eat these modification cassava people can avoid blindness .
do n't hungry , you know ,
this is a good thing . restaurant manager , though , is good .
i said , " why are people against this ?
please ask yourself : why we against ?
because we do n't want to move genome ?
this is just moved to add some genome , no chemicals .
with no hormone . we always want to get bigger food , better food , the other .
it 's not 酥 要造 meters , just to some people , is when we really understand the meaning of this process .
you know ?
if we do n't do that , but we do now , the future will be because some of the things we do n't want to happen and that 's a high - tech colonialism , guilt .
no more appropriate in other words to describe this situation .
this selfish , dirty , it would reduce our dignity , we have to stop doing .
okay , so after a very interesting conversations , you might say , “ machine , and you go into this and future 驶向 ” ?
of course that i would do .
now this machine , but we met in the great opportunity .
we can 如愿 any time machine .
we like to go there , can we really want to go .
we need to do this , we need to think , when we 驶向 time machine and into the future , we happy for our choice .
i believe we can , and i understand , this is what the world needs now .
thank you so .
thank you .
so .
in for a while i was interested in the potency of placebo , usually a magician not interested in placebo . but if you think , from my career that make some fake real things to people believe that they become reality .
in other words , 糖片 in some research can measure the effect of the placebo effect , because people think they happen is a drug or and give an example to tingling . if they believe that the suit tingling drugs , drugs in there will be obvious . it 's called the placebo effect .
fake things become really because people the perception of it .
we 're able to understand each other , i want to show you a very simple , the primary magic .
and i 'll tell you how i became . this is a from the 1950s in every child in the magic of magic .
i was in the '70s from child magic will learn it
let me show you do , and then .
and i 'll explain why i 'm going to explain .
see , how is it that magic .
this knife , you can check ; my hand , you can check
so i put 刀握 in my fists .
and my sleeve 挽 .
and that nothing can i like this in my sleeve up and down in this 压住 my wrist .
you can see that do n't have time to anything . i just 压住 nothing can my sleeve .
this is very simple .
i hope to open my hand , if all the magnetic physiology , i 'll stick to the knife .
in fact , it 's 粘得 so tight , i can even dumped this knife , it does n't .
nothing in my sleeve , no trick . you can look at all .
okay .
well , this is a i often teach the kids who interested in the magic of magic , because you can learn a lot about deception skills by learning this magic -- even though it 's a very simple way on the magic .
probably a lot of people know this magic .
it is what happens .
i hold knife .
i want to hold my wrist to make sure that nothing through my sleeve , this is a lie .
the reason that i hold wrist , the secret .
in my hand for you to move with you , this index finger , finger , finger , finger , i will shifting from here , where this 外侧 .
okay .
so many people sitting there , it has no childhood .
and this is my fingers , from here , move .
and i move my , in my fingers .
we can talk about why this vulnerable , why you do n't notice only three fingers down here , because you realize that way , and we deal with that , it 's not one , two , three . it together .
but it 's not that we 're going to talk about today . right ? i open my hand .
obviously , it was the magnet , but not by what physiology deception , where i index finger .
i 合上 my finger , finger , after i , like this movement , the degree turn the my fingers .
我拿开 this hand . you take the knife .
the tricks you can do to your friends and neighbors . thank you .
now , this placebo and what the relationship ?
i read about a year ago , it 's open my research .
i 'm not a doctor or researchers , so , for me , this is something very surprising .
it shows that if you give people a placebo in the form of white pills , like , if the aspirin is a circle of white pills , there 's a measurable placebo effect .
but if you change the shape of the placebo , you put it into a little blue , written in a pill , and that letter , it would have more obvious measurable .
even in a no two really drugs -- they are 糖片 .
but white pills is no good blue .
what ? it 's really confused me .
but in fact , that 's not end .
if you use capsule , they have more than any form of pills .
have the capsule , the yellow color red , other than the white capsule more effective .
a dose of .
no 三片 twice a day , a piece of statistics . ok . now i know . sorry .
but the point is .
dose and drugs .
and form and drugs .
if you want to the limits of placebo 针剂 inject you need .
right ? a syringe contains one or two , do n't work , you inject it into a patient .
in their head , so this is a powerful imagine , it should be much more perceptive than white pills .
it 's a strong , and i imagine a slide , i can show you statistics .
the point is white pills , no blue pill , no capsule good 针好 .
they 're not really drugs . this is just what you believe that it 's true in your body , and more .
i want to see if i can take this idea apply it to the magic tricks .
with some is obviously a fake tricks to make it really is .
we know from working with you , if you want to 实际效果 注射针 .
this is a cap pins . it 's very the 七寸 . i 'm going to put it 消 poison .
this is my muscles . it 's not 戴米安 特买肉 .
this is my skin . it 's not hollywood effect .
i will 刺入 side of the needle through the skin .
if you nervous 反胃 -- if you can easily 晕 yesterday -- i had some friends performance in hotels , some people i do n't know , a woman came from .
so , if you refer to the best in the next 30 seconds , you see elsewhere , in fact , you know , i 'll do it behind the beginning of the bad .
you 'll see , you can see . if you want .
well , this is happening here , i 皮肉 起点处 my arm below , i just a little passes .
sorry . i to you ?
and through my skin that a little bit in the other side .
now , we basically and knife tricks in the same position .
so much .
but you ca n't number now my fingers , right ?
so , let me show you them . one , two , three , four , five .
it is , " oh ,
i know what people think when they see this .
“ they said , oh , he wo n't be turned impale his own skin to play a few minutes . we ”
so , let me give you a little peek .
that looks ? good .
yeah , i know
these people in the back , “ . i did n't really see the . “
in the remote room can now 移近 .
let me give you look at this .
this is my skin . this is not really hollywood effect .
that 's my meat , i can rotate it .
sorry . if you feel disgust , look away at this .
or a few years later in the back of the people in this video from “ would say , oh , that kind of some work , but if it 's really see he 's a hole , and that 's a hole , if it would bleed .
let me 流点 blood to you .
yes , it is .
so , and i normally take the needle .
i washed my arm , to show you , i did n't hurt
but i think in this case , 使假 into really things in this idea , i will stop here , the next stage .
and within a few days later , i see you .
and i hope you expect . thank you very much .
are you talking about recently .
in the past five years , i asked the people there are more recent book about ” “ happiness in the book , they count about 40 ben , and more 没数 .
now more researchers are interested in happiness subject .
and a lot of “ happiness coach ” medium .
make people happy is their goal .
although 但现 多如牛毛 kind of work , there is still a cognitive trap , on these trap insight going to increase happiness is difficult .
i 'm going to talk about these cognitive trap .
these trap 既会 affect people happy 观感 itself , and also affect the judgment of happiness , because 人无完人 , we will go wrong .
the first trap of happiness is not willing to admit that complexity .
it turns out , is no longer use the word , because we 已用 其来 that a lot of things .
i think we should limit , it means , but basically , we have this idea and more complex view what happiness .
the second trap mix : basically between experience and memory is happy and think and feel happy life in life for the difference between your life satisfaction .
two meaning from , and it talks happiness lumped together .
the third trap focused illusion , unfortunately , in any case , when we think about the pleasant life , we 势必会 think it 's particularly important .
i mean , this is a real cognitive trap .
it 's to to .
now , i want to start with an example , i have personally 上过 class in 答问 之时 to -- i tell a story . [ unclear ] when he said he heard symphony that was told , but really playing music , but at the sharp end of the mayhem .
and then he excited that this is a mouse bad mess .
but not true .
what happens is just a bad for this experience of memory .
he had this experience .
and he had auditory 盛会 20 minutes .
but now has little , because he 's just leave a memory ; it 's bad memory , and the other 20 minutes of 盛会 was completely forgotten .
it tells us , we think about ourselves and others , two self .
for the first experience , this insight , in the present self , and also to that , but he basically just present .
a doctor to experience that self - -- as , when i ask you , “ doctors you touch it here ? ” .
another self is memory , the record , doctors 抒写 life , to find that when he would ask , how “ recently ” ?
or “ to albania fun ? ” similar problems .
experience self and memory is different , both mix is that we do n't part of happiness .
memory self - tell the story .
stories -- the upload a directly from memory .
we 're not going to talk about we tell stories .
our memory , it 's a story is we store down from the experience .
let me start with an example .
this is an old .
some really will take a pain patient treatments .
so detail capitals . no , no longer today sick , but in the 1990s , this way ways .
and every patient 60 seconds to report their pain .
here are two patient . this is their record .
i ask you : “ in the pain of who they ” ?
very simple question .
obviously , is the b . he colonoscopy longer time , a minute feel 痛疼 patients b , and also feel longer .
but now there 's another question : these people think they suffering ?
here 's a little accident .
the surprise of memory is a patient colonoscopy worse than b patients .
two different colonoscopy story , it 's the end of the story --
and two stories very intelligent -- but is obviously two different ...
one obviously feel bad than another .
feel more as this one is in the last time that what 痛绝 寰 . this is not a good story .
how do we know ?
because we asked them , and after the after a long time and ask them , how the whole of “ you colonoscopy ” ?
the result is a memory b clearly felt than worse .
now it 's self and memory of the conflict between experience .
from the perspective of self - experience , b is obviously patients sick .
explain how a situation , so we actually do a clinical trial , when do experiments , we got the expected outcome of patients , in fact , we can get a vibration and shoved down through time .
although or painful , but a lot of the patient .
on that , if you 're going to make a patient experience a sense of self - patients worse , but the memory of self - feel better , because you give people a story of a good thing , a good experience memory he threat story .
how to define 好坏 story ?
we tell the story is real and memory , and we tell the story is true .
时分 orgasm 好坏 depends on the end of the story .
on the end is very important , is dominated by the end of this story .
now , the experience of this self - life .
and he had a experience , one .
you ask : how these a “ ” ?
it 's very simple . they never disappear .
we live in a moment -- i mostly 算了算 -- just three seconds . psychology from a life that people have 六亿 about a month . and in about 六十万个 . they 're most without a moment .
most of whom was fully self - ignore memory .
, but now , you should be stored , because we feel that some of the experience , together make up our second life .
if we live , we 'll use these limited resources .
how to use them , it is important , but it 's not self - memory for our story .
so memory self and experience is great difference .
the biggest different between them is the time .
self - experience , if you have a holiday down , he first equally happy , and then two weeks portion of happiness is twice as much of a week vacation .
and that is not a self - memory .
for self - memory , two holidays 并不比 during the week vacation much more , because no new memory in .
the story scenarios 如旧 .
so time from memory self and experience of the impact of this story . time .
and memories of self - is not tell stories .
decided , because it 's really do patients , if you 've had two different from the surgeon decided to do a 镜检查 , and now they options to do it through a patient , choice is going to feel better , the memory of this is how selected doctor .
the choice is doing self - 无从置喙 experience .
in fact , we do n't do in two experience . we 're in two different experience memory make choices .
and when we think the future , we do n't usually think in the form of experience .
in the future we envision form of memory .
you can see the self is tyrant , memory , you can imagine memory self in dragging experience self , he 's through self - do n't experience to dragging ourselves .
i have an idea , when we 放假 often 放假 , there 's a big part for self - memory .
i think it 's kind of 难来 dialectical .
we use the memory ?
it can explain why can be memory self - self .
it reminds me of a vacation , a few years ago in the south pole spend holidays , this is the best i can say a vacation , other than vacation , i often think of the vacation .
this journey with me about three weeks of 记忆量 away , just in the last four years of about 25 minutes .
now , as i open 资料夹 about 600 a photograph , i could take an hour to memories .
three weeks journey with the most and a half hours to memories .
it seems disproportionately .
this little with me , because i remember less , but if you remember there will be a more practical . why we memory for more than on experience ?
so i want you to think about a thought experiment .
if you when you know , the next vacation vacation vacation after all this will destroyed , and you swallow a forgotten to forget everything you .
so , you would want to have the same vacation ?
if you pick a vacation , you will generate conflict between the two self , the idea you have to this conflict , and it 's not easy , because if you just think about time you get an answer . but if you get another answer only about memory .
why are we 选此 彼 , rather than this problem is that we need to make choices between two self .
now , two of self - two different happy .
two insight for happiness and the two self .
so you ask : “ experience how happy self is ” ?
and then you ask : how happy “ self - moment experience ” ?
these moment of happiness is incredibly complicated process .
measure how emotions ?
by the way , we now experience as time goes and feel happy self has a concept of it .
and the joy is completely memory self animal .
it 's not one more happy life .
it for their life with more and more like .
radically insight .
if you ca n't tell these two of the . i ca n't 参透 happiness and other live good students , always 不透 happy , because this research .
in recent years , self - experience happiness and memory , self - fulfilling terms 已能 to now to metric and two ,
gallup poll company in the world had a recently , over 500,000 people were asking a question like this , that 's how they and their lives and how they experience , except that this company did surveys .
in recent years , and we know about two of happiness .
i think we learned is two major 天壤之别 .
and if you can get a people living with , but it ca n't tell you how happy they are alive , and vice versa .
just to give you one of the connection is a basic , between them about 50 percent .
you mean , when you saw a man told his dad 六尺 high , you know that have much higher ?
well , you might be a basic , but not really sure .
you ca n't judgment .
if somebody to quality of life , and i said he beat eight or 10 percent , you ca n't get their experience how happy self .
so the very low .
we know what to make people happy satisfied .
we know that money is important , very important goals .
we need to know happiness is through the people we love , needs to spend time with them in one .
although and other things , but this is the key factors .
so if you want to make two self - happiness , you have to abandon 旧习 and to do something different .
i mean , we at least not happy as good 代名词 .
this is two 天壤之别 .
now , very quickly talk about another reason we ca n't understand the nature of happiness , that 's how we look at life and how do we have life is different .
so , how happy when you ask people in california , you ca n't get the answer .
because when you think 加州人 问时 , you must be happy , and you live in ohio .
how happy when you want to live in california , when you think , california and other 州域 terms , like climate .
it turns out the climate conditions for self - experience is not important and thinking about self - measure how happy do n't really important .
but since reality self - dominated by thinking , some people might get this conclusion that moved to california .
they moved to california to make life happier , and track watch the next , they will be really interesting thing .
they experience is not become happier .
we all know this .
but when thing happened , they feel happy . because they think more , they remember ohio 坏天气 . and so they think they made the decision .
happy to understand life , i hope i 've really hard to make you a basic hard , and understand what this process .
thank you .
chris anderson : thank you . i want you to have a question .
thank you very much .
a few weeks ago , we had a communications , and you say you from the gallup poll was found an interesting phenomenon .
so you can share with us ? we have a few minutes .
daniel 卡纳曼 : no problem .
i found a very interesting from the gallup poll numbers , find it 实属 accident .
we found a happy about self - experience .
that is the income and how many people will feel .
that , for less than 六万美元 american year , it 's a big part of the sample , almost 六十万 people , these people is quite indicator of income , less than 60 dollars ...
so : 60,000 dollars .
卡纳曼 : 60,000 dollars .
60,000 dollars a year not happy , and the income , they are n't happy .
and when over 60,000 income , we get a horizontal line .
see that a flat line .
money is obviously ca n't buy experience of happiness , but not money can give you the 悲郁 , and we know 地测 painful , very much .
for another self , self - memory . you have a believe the story .
the more you make , the more you happy .
it 's no emotional .
so life : but danny , and freedom and pursuit of happiness is all americans .
if you take this , so , we turn to the idea , for example , taxed policy .
politicians possible in this country and find at the and 施政 ?
卡纳曼 : i think people have cognitive research to happiness in 谋划 policy .
but this is propagating is 颇慢 cognitive in the united states , of course , but in the u.k. , it was 亦然 fermentation , other countries .
and people started to cognitive in general 谋划 considering a policy , or to happiness .
although it 's going to time , but they will start to think about the experience of happiness . they or for life , and so quickly , we 're going to understand this .
how fields , several happiness , but , you think about how you is memory self or want to experience .
within a few years , i think it 's going to influence policy .
america has huge effort to measure the experience of happiness .
within 10 or 20 years , i think this will be part of the country statistics .
this issue is for me in the future will be a few years of a policy issue .
thank you very much the behavioral economics .
thank you very much daniel 卡纳曼 .
i 'm a game designer , i called JaneMcGonigal
i 've been online for 10 years . i hope to the next 10 years is like playing a game that simple in the real problem .
now , i 'm going to explain why i said that if people well some big , more good game here , of course , and you can spend more time in the game you think i explain more .
people now with the game time where people can every 30 billion hours with time on online can reach 30 billion hours a week
some of you may think “ spent more time playing ” .
maybe some more , because to think about life of a lot of urgent question we need to deal with
but in the future , the institute for the research we spend on games do n't .
30 million hours of the game for a week in the real problem for 30 million hours of the game far less than a week for the real problem far .
in fact , i think to live better on earth , in fact , i think in order to survive on earth , we need to increase of game time
i 've been calculated games , what we need time 210 billion hours every week
maybe some against common sense , but i want to say that again , so that was enough to understand if we want to address hunger , poverty , like climate change , global conflict , obesity , i believe we need to be encouraging people to play at least 210 billion hours online and week after 10 years , of course , this will
actually , i was very seriously , not a joke .
here is , we put this scene together explain the game for human race can live in the future is really important .
this portrait picture taken by phil Toldano .
he wanted to capture game change of emotion , so he put photography device is game in front of gamers
this is a game player classic .
now , if you 're not a game you wo n't aware of this photograph really .
pressing , you might feel the fear of concentration , not a or is focused on solve a problem .
if you 're a game , you 'll feel something different wrinkles is up around the corner , including 嘴角 wrinkles around is the same eyebrows signs , and this is a very optimistic 翘起 up is surprised .
this game , that 's going to get in the game epic triumph , 如诗般 wonderful 巨大胜利 , an triumph .
-- you 've heard about this word , gamers that some of you are .
this epic triumph of a result , but it 's very exciting is that in successful before you could n't even think about it .
imagine this even beyond your success
when you to do , and once you struck by their skills triumph of this is called “ epic ”
and the players to get this .
and , of which is , what we expect the global one out of the barriers of expressions can 排除万难 are 无往不胜 .
now , unfortunately , when we deal with daily life of the emergency , we tend to see this .
usually i call this “ at ” expression that actually make my own life , and could see ? ok .
that i make “ ” good life do .
in california , which is a community old berkeley . my ph.d. , i read a doodling and dr. research project is “ why we think the virtual world better than the real world ”
and this is a lot of gamers .
we ca n't feel like in the game for real .
i do n't think of success , and that is not worth although to success of
we do in the game world with more successful , but here said to the urgent thing to do with the intrinsic motivation , the inspiration and collaborative
when we in the world , i think we can do the best and we will see a message to help people to solve a problem with frustration and progress , we 're going to stand up , and on .
but , in real life , when we fail , when we had obstacles , we usually do n't feel .
we usually think very depressing , what , what anxiety , frustrated , 灰心 or even cynical
this time we did n't feel when the game would n't exist in the game these feelings .
this is something i read graduate research that 's when i was graduate research .
could n't do anything , let 's think of the game is impossible ?
how do we get from the game that feeling to reality in social work ?
so , i study some games like " world of warcraft platform that they ideal solve cooperative
i noticed something that these things could make triumph of epic in online
first thing is , whenever you in this game , especially in the world of warcraft " game in a lot of different role for you trust , and they will help you save the world task .
but not all the task , and you just completely match the task of
so , you have the ability to do it
designers do n't give you a , you ca n't do to the task .
but the limits of ability to do this to you , so you have to you the best position in the world of warcraft everybody has its own
there 's no audience there have been something very important and waiting for you to do
and there 's a lot of people in the game world can collaborative
whether you up , where there are thousands of people waiting for you to do with those huge herculean task and
in real life are not so easy this feeling of hundreds of thousands of partners in our fingertips in real life without that simple .
in these beautiful , and the plot of games to us , and what motivates us .
and , for any trying to what we have a positive for sure .
you 've heard of , with grades and power to add to add intellectual
in real life , and we have this sustainable .
when i go , for example , this stage , i do n't have the ability to speak 加一 crazy ideas 加一 capacity , let alone a crazy idea to add 20 .
i do n't get any in real .
in the network 虚拟环境 , like in the world of warcraft " 虚拟环境 network , like " world of warcraft and collaborative is a very 惬意 thing because we can keep to the final triumph and so we would have been 沉醉于 because in the game world
because it 's better than reality .
so far , the world of warcraft " of the gamers have spent 593 for years time to solve 艾泽拉斯 to solve the problem of virtual 艾泽拉斯 inside of virtual .
it 's not bad thing .
it sounds like a bad thing .
we write these numbers : 593 walking upright years ago we started human ancestors primates .
this is the first upright - walking primate
so , when we talk about when we spend so much time on the game is the only way to understand it reasonable : to think about what we spend time in human evolution . how many and this is how unusual thing .
that 's appropriate to , because you spend a lot of time to play games that we can change our ability to 做人 we can change our ability to 做人
we 're evolving a more collaboration and more robust .
this is really , i am convinced
look at this survey is an interesting survey by a researchers from carnegie mellon out in a country game atmosphere very , very young people today in a game . the young people today in the country , 21 years ago , on average per spent on the game up to 10,000 hours
now , 10,000 hours is a very interesting values mainly because for two reasons .
first , the american children from fifth time is 10080 hours of the high school , of course , you have good time , the attendance .
education , we have a parallel tracking data , it says : the young people doing a good gamers spend time with they learn in school the knowledge of the time .
some of you would read the book " the outsider MalcomGladwell . "
so you author theory success of insight and not to 10,000 hours laws .
this rule is based on cognitive research if we could spend 21 years ago or 10,000 hours of learning , trying to do other things , so we can get hit on these things .
we 're going to be in what we do anything world .
now , what we focus on is good game for young generation
the biggest problem is “ gamers are good at what ” ?
if we can give you the answer to a unprecedented human capital purchase
they spend at least that 's what we now have every hour to play the game of gamers
they 're 技艺 virtuoso game five billion people at some things .
in the next decade there at 10 million new game player in a field
if , then i tell you , which is this thing .
game industry and development now , it 's been 低能耗 mobile phones , and from broadband internet wireless networks of gamers to change the world , especially from india , china and brazil players , in the same platform rodeo .
据预测 , in the next 10 years will have 10 million players in the new
and we would have 15 亿之众 gamers
so , i started thinking about early , where these games are going to carry us ?
i think there are four in the first is this for positive state , an emergency optimistic
imagine you extreme it self - inspired
the optimism is with their 必胜信念 急切 desire to solve immediately .
gamers still believe in victory impossible is possible .
gamers not isolated .
they 're very good at a highly social structure .
an interesting research shows that we prefer the game with people i beat , even if they are so
reason is , in the process of the game we of trust , which is why we in the process of the game of trust .
and we trust , is because they have the same rules we spend the same time , the common goal , we 're going to - shoulder together until game .
based on this , it can build game with the trust and collaborative
and more robust , we 'll build a network of relations
the productivity of happiness , i love this
" world of warcraft players cost 22 hours a week , the average play games like a part of the reasons .
is because , as opposed to leisure when we play games or shopping , we 加倍努力 game we get happier .
as humans , we prefer that although hard work , but more interesting things .
if appropriate to provide a task gamers , they 've constantly trying to play .
and finally , epic .
gamers like disables in 威严 of those stories about human star .
any , a little bit of what you will be part of that ultimately good vision , you 've all heard of wikipedia , the largest wiki wiki is an open internet , that many people together create hypertext system .
the second largest wiki , is the world of warcraft wiki , in about eight million article "
there are 500 million people every month using it
inside of the information about the world of warcraft " than any other subjects information on the web .
it 's created a story epic .
also creation , as a about the world of warcraft " epic huge knowledge of resources .
this is that four superpowers to focus on the thing is the example of gamers highly license , a group of hope , a
they think they have the ability to change the world are thought to change the world .
but the problem is they believe can change the world is , not the virtual world
that 's what i 'm trying to solve the problem .
a economists called edward Castronova .
his work very remarkable research people spend so much time and energy and money in online .
he said , we are seeing the “ of people and indulge virtual game of ”
because he 's an economist , so he is rational .
and he said ...
a game designer , i 'm like , i just full of energy
and he said , " because game player in the virtual game became more get more than in real life .
they can have better than real social relations in the game player can get better and reward than real achievement
so , he said , spend more time for game player in the space in more than social reality
now i still think it 's rational
but anyway , it 's not the best .
we have to start now social reality to build a game
so , i from something happened in 25 years ago .
these are the oldest dice , by the sheep joints bone .
before we designed game controller we already have a joint of dice
this is the first human designed game instruments
if you 're familiar with the greek historian , like greek historian 希罗多德 , you know what invented this history play history and the reason is that ?
希罗多德 said , games , especially dice by Lydia minor western rich 古国 kingdom , in a big famine .
history , obviously , that a serious famine is lydia king had decided to do something they had to do crazy .
and each other people suffering , fighting
very crisis . they need an extreme forms of solution .
according to 希罗多德 , and they invented dice game in a country of policy and one day , everybody can eat all day , but only game
attention playing dice because game very attractive people in so we can self - fulfilling “ production ” happiness in people will forget the fact that they have food to eat
the people will through games through the next day they 'll eat .
according to the 希罗多德 said is lydia is spent 18 years with this way , the way they play games day eating day famine well spent .
this is where we how game .
we play a game of escape .
we from reality by game environment 残缺不全 , ca n't satisfying things and what we need .
and this can happen to .
it 's very excited .
according to 希罗多德 frankl , famine in 18 years without any sign of a better and better , so people to the last dice game king
he national average people into two groups .
they play with a dice video games will on one side of the expedition adventure .
they will live Lydia to find a new place the remains of the people who can spend existing resources left famine shouldered the burden of spread civilization , 兴旺
it sounds crazy , is n't it ?
but dna evidence roman ancestors recently -- 伊楚 利亚人 Etruscans -- and and 古利 Lydians 迪亚人 and have the same genetic .
the scientists find 希罗多德 crazy story recently historically 确有其事
geologists have to look for evidence that there was a global 过长 for 20 years on earth can explain this cool this big famine by .
so , this seemingly crazy story 兴许 really
they play games for their culture and avoid reality in games for 18 years eventually they get down 参悟 out how to bring people together through games which way to save the civilization
we can also this way .
people from 1994 , playing of warcraft .
first real - time in this world of warcraft series strategy game and that 's 16 years ago .
the dice game for 18 years we play the 16 years of warcraft
so i can , we 're ready to take in a game change our lives and epic a game .
by is half of the civilization to find new and now we have every 周长达 time 210 billion hours of video games .
let 's half the people in the game day until we can go to an hour in the real problem
you might ask , how we “ in the game in the real problem ? ” 's i positive in the last few years into the reason i work where i work institute called future “ ”
it is in a office ads gave about how we think about the future .
we do n't try to to predict the future .
, but we will create the future .
we 've been thinking of the best results , and we want to try to make people will think that reality .
we crave epic triumph of also giving people to win .
i want to show you a short 三款 game i did , they are trying to try to give the future of people can create your own epic triumph , provide some .
this is " 无油 world . "
this game make in 2007 .
when it 's a game , you oil shortage managed to survive .
shortage of oil is fiction , but we 'll spend a lot of what you would think that 's really , in that affect your life and make you feel we have no oil . so , when you open your game up , and tell us live video we 'll give you the news in real time data precisely tell you precisely tell you the cost of oil , oil is what is the cost of food supply of transportation how affected how affected , and will tell you whether school in riots happened if it were off , where everything is really , you 'll find out how to deal with these problems in the real world . we 'll ask you to put these things on blogs uploading video or .
in 2007 , 17 people in the google test game we follow these people live in the next three years
i can tell you that this is a very to experience .
nobody wanted to change the way they live because they think 无损 environment , or because they think that ,
but , if you let them in an amazing experience , and tell them , “ . we 've impoverishing our oil ”
this is a wonderful story and you hear amazing experience .
challenge , look how to survive , most of you keep them in the game of gamers to most of the gamers to keep them in the game .
in the next , save the world of our choice in the game bigger problem , harder than shortage of oil .
institute in the future “ ” we made a game called " Superstruct future we “ institute ” made a game called " Superstruct . "
this hypothesis is , supercomputer calculated that only 23 years of life on earth human time .
this supercomputer global extinct predict system called "
people are like jerry in the game in brook 海默 movie .
jerry brook 海默 movie , you know , you have a dream team members 精悍 contingent , your contingent astronauts and scientists , was in some of them have save the world skills
-- in the game we design , we do n't use 五人 group model that we designed everybody can be part of the elite contingent your job is to develop the future of energy , safe , food and health care system and the network of social security .
we have 8,000 people play this game , eight weeks .
they concluded 500 crazy , but a very creative solutions , if you can go to google " #atlgas " Superstruct , you can see .
and we will be a game in march 三日 on it . this is a collaboration with the world bank .
if you can do this game , you 'll get to the world bank certified 届 2010 social innovators
working with sub - saharan africa around at the university of we invited they learn social innovation .
more like a cartoon novel . we have about game equilibrium , like the skills of perspective , knowledge network , sustainable , insight and 机智
apologizing to you . i can tell young people in this world where this game , especially those in the developing world can people to focus on this game , they started to think with their own social enterprise to save the world people can benefit from this game and inspiration .
i 'm going to end my talk .
i want to ask a question .
what will happen ?
we have so much good gamers we might have in the game is we do n't want to do the experiment , but anything ever save the world
i hope you agree with me , which is a game player is a huge 资源库 we can make them to do real world , because this is a game of change .
we have these amazing superpowers , the productivity of happiness , highly social structure of an emergency desire and epic optimism .
sincerely , i hope that we can play the game , that in the next one can live on this planet in the
i want you to join us , to make or support this game
when i look forward to the next 10 years , i must first for two things , we can create any future that we can imagine secondly , we can anything we want to play the game
from game we started to change the world .
thank you .
i want to find a few months before the big share with you . i was " wired magazine wrote an article for a italy
i was writing always put 同义词 dictionary 手边 and i 've realized after the editor had never in my life in the dictionary look “ ” disabled mean .
let me put this 词条 read to you .
“ ” disabled , adjectives , for : “ 残废 , helpless , useless , you stop , the destruction , injured , being destroyed , and , disintegrating damage , exhausted , weak , power , the loss of function , paralyzed , body obstacles aging , and , there were tired , exhausted , useless , around the crap , do n't considered ” 另见 : “ injury , useless , the ” sick .
the opposite : “ health , strong , capable of ”
i was quiet verse that content to a friend of mine , i started laughing . it 's ridiculous when 我念到 “ being destroyed ” , i up to stop after being with these words to insult to restore emotions .
synonymous with the book , my old dictionary , and i thought , it 's also be old 本词典 version .
but in fact , it 's 出版日期 on family should 刚上 elementary school i was in the 1980s outside of the environment for the cognitive and with my kids around the world and connections
thankfully , i was 没用过 同义词 dictionary
i mean , through the 同义词 dictionary “ disability ” explain itself can see the world of life , i do n't like i disabled . in the world that we disabled , positive , but for today , i was in my life with all the adventure opportunity that for me .
so , i immediately go the “ ” itself in 2009 version of disability 同义词 lexicon of the explanation i expect to see some important
i 'm going to give you read “ disability ” new version of itself .
unfortunately , 词条 did n't explain how much better than that .
this 词条 " close to the opposite " especially me . they 're two words : “ intact , the sound ”
in fact , this is not just a few words .
when people that negative words for the disabled , actually is out of disabled people .
remarkable is that the disabled people behind the words of the heart of values , and this process of values .
our language affect our mind and the way we look at the world , the other way .
many ancient greek , actually , the social believe that words curse of power , because it once said that is really exist .
so , what we want things what there is no ability , or a people who have ?
sometimes we just to give a name adults and children are 限制住 their development , they might be , the shadow , their ability to question
do we do n't mind 之门 on for them ?
i have a life for people , i opened the door of mind , i was a doctor in relatively state care as i was a 明顿 . i work Dupont institute .
his name is Pizzutillo is an italian - american his name , obviously , a lot of american 人念 out difficult , so let 's call him p doctor .
p doctors always a colorful tie , for people , and that he was very well with kids
besides body training courses in his hospital of the time i was happy .
that i 'm going to use 很粗 , the colored , rich , flexible tape leg over and over again doing 体能训练 exercise i just 恨透 muscle 恨透了 tape , i even gave them the name .
i was a five - year - olds , and doctors and p bargaining 求 he stop me the training . of course , i 'm not stopping
p doctor , but one day when i was doing 体能训练 ruthless , look at me , well , that 's crashing training . and he said to me , it 's a strong girl “ aimee , you . i feel one day you can put these tape broke
when you broke , you reward 100 dollars “
obviously , this is a trick p doctor . he wanted me to do is just one day i simply do n't love of 体能训练 “ patients become 二楼 ward all five of the richest ” to temptation p doctor , but i did something that is a successful agenda i hate into a new , full of landscape experience .
today , i think , p doctors that vision and he gave me the girl ” “ strong that term impact on my self - awareness how big the now , i 've realized that i was a bright future 强壮有力 , i
p doctors good example of this just shows the power of adults to burn a child a potential .
but , in front of the more about the dictionary 同义词 example of language , and we did n't take what we want to see things become reality does n't disabled realized that they are actually capable of
the technology of the development and our language as social time not
from the standpoint of medicine , of course , in my legs , fake repair my vision laser surgery artificial titanium king , provide old 股骨头 knee replacement surgery can make people more for all of these technologies and beyond the ability to use them to give them the constraints of social platform for the disabled , and we can self to allow us to on a global scale , with .
so , technology is more to the truth is that we show a permanent , each one is very powerful , we can do for society are contribution and the power is the greatest human capital .
talk about human environment skills that i feel very interesting , because i “ overcome adversity ” people often want to talk about this subject today i want to make a statement “ overcome adversity ” 这一说 people do n't work for me to when i say something about this , i started thinking about why my laptop .
“ overcome adversity ” this 26 or a postulation mean that , all the other end of the experience of a tough , and this experience itself with happiness and success , not like that i can success because i had bypassed as a life with a set of challenges 人所要 around it faster some of my other .
but in fact , these really changed our challenge , in our life journey 烙 the mark change is probably the body , that might be spiritual , both
i want to say , facing challenges 不失为 is a good thing .
with adversity , we should treat it as around it to continue our lives .
actually , adversity is part of our lives .
i imagine adversity into my own .
sometimes it looks very , very small , but it still in me
, of course , i 'm not trying to fight against adversity and the value of people .
we adversity to experience and challenge in life we all but the problem that we focus on is not whether you 're going to face adversity , but how to deal with it
so , let our responsibility is not just about people live in . but they can form 从容应对 adversity .
when we feel no ability to adapt to kids , we actually hurt them .
from the standpoint of medical objective is what i 'm a disabled subjective from society to think about this is a “ disabled ” i have a big difference between
in fact , what i want to face the world is the only question describe and injustice of me .
we want to protect the people we care about the cold , we tell them , or sometimes diagnostic report , for their future life . but what we have to look at what we do for these people will destroy
maybe , people used to focus on their own and thinking about how to fix these flaws in this thinking of taboo for the disabled more serious than in the disabled physiology
we do n't from a whole view disabled their ability to admit that that they 're very difficult situation of the problems .
we can effectively a assessment of people in the social value .
so in the eyes , we should n't be disabled physically , but as they should be aware of .
and some of the most important disabled in between humans and creativity is there .
so hard for years , is not relegate , no. it 's not what we want to avoid or to the opposite , we should be looking in the opportunities .
actually , i think that it is not to overcome adversity , " we should embrace it 坦然 face it 摔打 with it , i took a term 摔角 摔打 , even dance with it .
maybe , if we can adversity as natural , them , that something useful burden of it is not for us .
we celebrate darwin 's 200th anniversary of the year when darwin wrote species of evolution in 150 years ago when he to a truth about human .
he said 那句话 about what that means is , can survive species are not strongest , not the smart , but most adapt .
the paradox is create mother
darwin , and you all the ability to reproduce from human reveals that transformation is that after the struggle human experience .
i again , the greatest human ability , and adapt .
maybe , before we 接受考验 , what we do n't know .
maybe that 's what adversity role of an understanding of self and personal .
so , we can make a gift .
we can adversity as a change .
instead of grueling years
adversity is a change , and we just before it .
i think , we created the dilemma is " orthodox this concept "
well , what is “ orthodox ” ?
“ orthodox ” does n't exist .
i know what , what is “ “ normal ” typical ” , but i do n't know what “ orthodox ” , that if there 's poverty , the so - called “ ” orthodox people , you 're interested in them ?
and i want to do .
if we do n't spend energy to pursue “ orthodox ” but into discovering all kinds of possibility , of all kinds of ability , risk of a lot of potential that they would all be better 充分运用 unique ability valuable , they do for their community .
anthropologists tell us we always hope that we as humans group where people are useful is capable of doing .
six years ago , the neanderthals society is a very good evidence neanderthals raise their social 老弱病残 because they believe in the old people 阅历 of life is they society is very valuable .
old people will be as useless instead , they never as very valuable .
one day a few years ago , i 'm from 菜市场 is northeastern pennsylvania 红区 that i was standing next to 一筐 tomatoes
because the summer , i 'm wearing shorts
in my behind the sound of a man “ , yeah ? it 's not amy 慕林斯 ” ?
i turned around , that is an old man i do n't know
and i said , " mr. “ sorry , i remember you ” we met ?
and he said , “ well , you do n't remember that between meet .
because , i was your from your mother , in the womb “ .
and that is , well , i met a people
and of course , i want to end .
this is 基恩 doctor i just by my mother was a story that i know that one is a two weeks later , 产儿 晚产
for in my mother was to take care of her doctor vacation to last by 基恩 doctor , so that people do n't know me before my parents baby .
when i was born without fibulas my foot two toes , all misplaced 基恩 doctor to convey the bad news
he said to me , " i was diagnosed report parents tell you and i said , you 'll never walk you never 跑跑跳跳 like other kids , you will never independent life since then , you through your work i became a 大骗子 ”
mr. 基恩 did , and the great thing , he started from my childhood newspaper all about my story and i collected , including in the second time anagrams won the competition and child in a halloween , to get at the time , and i , in reading 基恩 doctor in the local students with my story education he my story 哈奈曼 medical students and 赫尔 the medical education
he story that i called him in the course of x called the human mind the potential of
no medical diagnostics can explain how big will be the power of this will a quality of life .
基恩 doctor said to me on “ , even though there are many others , my view , according to my experience for children , even give them support rarely achievement ” they can .
see , the idea of 基恩 doctor changed .
he realized the medical diagnostics and a guy with this out there are differences between the way .
and the idea of a few years , i had to shift , for example , if you ask when i was 15 years now , i would change a 真腿 毫不犹豫 i nervously
because i want to get that “ orthodox ”
but if you ask me , the same question i 'm going to 三思 today .
because i use this to my arm , this experience .
maybe i 've 脱胎换骨 inside , because , for me in that i met people on the door of the world more than people to my heart of clouding
see , what you need is a person can show you the power of your own
embracing the human soul , if you give people a key , his own with this keys on their own power and , you can use this keys at open door for somebody else you education is the best way to them .
because you teach them for ourselves on the door of new
in fact , meaning from “ “ education of the word ” 唤出 word ”
“ 唤出 ” , which is the stuff in policed to potential .

here 's a case of the 1960s britain british up from elementary school children to the middle of this process .
in the u.k. called “ 统考 ” , in the united states , we call the test “ tracking ”
the students to test scores , low into a , b , c , d 四等
and a student 学更难 class , a better teacher , etc.
this 为期 grades should be in three months to the students were told they 're waiting for a d told that they are very smart three months at the end of the experiment equivalent of the students have a 等生 .
this case , of course , the other side of the research also has 令人心寒 that is , who was supposed to wait for students were told they 're a d students
three months at the end of the experiment .
they have a lot of people dropping out .
a point of this experiment is , in the teachers are also know .
teachers were 调包 students do n't know .
teachers just being told what is a 等生 , which is also " differentiated " d 等生 teachers .
so , i think the real “ ” disability is a beat a soul no hope for the future of a soul perceive a soul 般天 really curiosity soul lost a child with a lost human imagination soul
if we can make the human soul , 始终保持 hope to see ourselves and others , it 's soul beauty soul curiosity and imagination , even if we give it is very good use their own power .
as a soul that still of those qualities , so it can create new way of life and possibilities
